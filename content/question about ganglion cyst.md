vital isgns are normal BMI is 28, there is slight ulnar deviation at both wrists, with a 2-cm mass on the extensor surface of the right wrist and no overlying skin discoloration. the mass is firm, mobile and notender to palpation, and it transilluminates on pen light examination 

which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

1. epidermoid cyst 
2. ganglion cyst (c)
3. lipoma 
4. rheumatic nodule 
5. tendinous xanthoma {i} <

ganglion systs are generally harmless, lesions that are more common in patients with underlying joint disorders or prior joint injury. they cna occur in both upper and lower extremity but are most common at the wrist. ganglion cysts are typically filled with mucinous fluid and often communicate witht the underlying joint via a hollow pedicle. fluid is postulated to flow from the joint space to the cyst, and a one way valve mechanism prevents return flow to the joint. 

the diagnosis of ganglion cyst is usually obvious on inspection and can be confirmed on transillumination of the mass. if in doubt, ultrasound or MRI can confirm the diagnosis but imaging is rarely necessary. most ganglion cysts resolve spontaneouly and require not treatment. for the few patients with painful and persistent symptoms, options include aspiration and surgical excision.
