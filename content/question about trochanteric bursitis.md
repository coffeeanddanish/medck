53 year old man comes to the office due to right-sided lateral hip pain that makes it difficult for him to lie on that side while sleeping 

he describes the pain as burning and localizes it to the outer surface of his thigh. because the patient has not been able to sleep well due to the pain, he now feels fatigued. the pain has recently occured during the day and is worse with activity and prolonged standing. the patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. vital signs are within normal limits. 

BMI is 37, physical exam shows tenderness over the lateral aspect of the right hip and buttock with deep palpation. neurologic exam shows no abnormalities. which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's pain? 

1. femoral neck stress fracture 
2. greater trochanteric pain syndrome (c)
3. hip osteoarthritis 
4. iliotibial band syndrome 
5. meralgia paresthetica 
6. osteoid osteoma 

"This patient has greater trochanteric pain sydnrome (GTPS). GTPS is an overuse syndrome involving the tendons on gluteus medius and minimus wehre they run over the greater trochanter. GTPS is sometimes termed 'trocheanteric bursitis' although the bursae are not the source of the pain. GTPS typically presents with chronic lateral hip pain that is worsened with repetetive hip flexion (eg., climbing stairs, walking uphill, getting out of a car) or hying on the affected side. 

this diagnosis is based primarily on clinical findings. physical examination shows local tenderness over the greater trochanter during flexion. hip range of motion is normal, although abduction may aggravate the pain. X-ray is commonly performed to rule out concurrent hip joint disorders, ultrasound may show chronic degeneration/tendinosis in the affected tendons. 

intial treatment of GTPS includes local heat, activity modification, NSAIDs. physical therapy is often helpful as well. patients with persistent symptoms despite conservative therapy may benefit from local conrticosteroid injection."

[[greater trochanteric pain syndrome]]

wrong answer rationales 

femoral neck stress fracture - stress fracture of the femoral neck can cause lateral hip pain. but htis condition is typically caused by prolonged, strenuous exercise (such as runner training) and is otherwise uncommon in patients without underlying bone disease 

hip osteoarthritis - usually the location of pain is in the deep, medial aspect of the hip joint. radiation to the groin or thigh is more typical than radiation to the lateral hip, and hti spatient's tenderness over the trochanter is more consistent with GTPS 

Iliotibial band syndrome is common overuse syndrome tht arises where the iliotibial band passes over the lateral femoral condyle. it presents with lateral knee, not hip, pain and tenderness at the condyle, just proximal to the knee joint 

Meralgia paresthetica is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve where it passes under the inguinal ligament. the pain and paresthesia typically occur in a variable region of the midlateral thigh. trochanteric tenderness would not be seen 

osteoid osteoma is a bening tumor that commonly affects the proximal femur, and can cause nocturnal pain. however, it typically occurs in children, adolsc., and young adults.
