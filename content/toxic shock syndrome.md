TSS typically occurs when an exotoxin-producing strain of staph aureus proliferates in a _retained foreign body_ (tampon, nasal or would packing) or a would infection (surgical or post-partum)

certain staph aureus exotoxins (TSS toxin-1 for ex) act as superantigens, proteins that bypass normal antigen processing and bind directly to the surface of class II MHC 

superantigens indiscriminately activate T cells, leading to the massive release of inflammatory cytokines. manifestations of TSS typically arise rapidly over 1-2 days and include fever, shock, widespread macular rash that eventually desquamates (usually after 1-2 weeks), and multiorgan failure (decreased urine output, altered mentation). treatment includes supportive case (like IV fluids), removal of foreign body, and empiric antibiotic therapy (vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin)

as you can see, this explanation is taken from the answer of the corresponding quesiton and its shit. this is how it feels to store information without explanation. 

first of all, is toxic shock syndrome due to gram negative or positive? dividing bacteria can be done in several ways, my favorite is negative v positive. although i don't know it thoroughly, I do know that g neg releases endotoxins in the gut which cause GI distress and symptoms. this is an easy method to differentiate. although there is overlap, g neg is famous for this 

but what does staph have to do with g neg?
