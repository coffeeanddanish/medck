45 yo woman comes to the hospital due to sudden-onset right sided flank pain that started 12 hours ago 

the patient has had fever and malaise for the past 2 weeks and has been taking OTC ibuprofen intersittantly for a presumed viral. she has had no dyspnea, cough, chest pain or urinary symptoms. temp 38.7C, 110/78, pulse is 102, resp are 16. lung sounds are normal. a 2/6 systolica murmur is present at the cardiac apex, right flank tenderness is present. the remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities: 

hb 12.9 
leukocyte 13,000
plates 178,000
SCr 1.1 
Urinalysis 
casts none 
protein 1+ 
blood 3+ 
wbc 1-2 
bacteria none 
nitrites negative 
leukocyte esterase neg 

There is CT scan - which shows (R) sided wedge shaped parenchyma defect 

which of the follwoing is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms? 

1. acute interstitial nephritis 
2. acute pyelonephritis 
3. glomerulonephritis 
4. nephrolithiasis 
5. renal infarction 


"this patient with flank pain, hematureia, proteinuria and wed-shaped infart of the renal parenchyma noted on CT scan has a renal infarction. renal infarctions occur from a variety of etiologies (atrial fibrillation, renal artery trauma, hypercoagulibility). however, this patients 2-week history of fevers associated with leukocytosis and possible mitral regurgitation due to the systolic murmur at the apex suggests infective endocarditis IE. IE results from seeding of the endocardium and cardiac valve during periods of bacteremia (the source of which is not always immediately apparent); embolization of valvular evegtations can result in end-organ ischemia and infarction

renal infarctions typically manifest with acute flank pain, nausea, and vomiting, fever may also occur. urinalysis classically demonstrates hematuria and proteinuria w/o casts. a rise in serum creatinine may occur but is more common with bilateral or very large, unilateralinfarction. other charsacteristic lab abnormalities include an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, leukocytosis, and elevation in crp. a contrast-CT or MRI demonstrating a wedge-shaped cortical infarction is doagnostic"
