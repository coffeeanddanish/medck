55 year old man is brought to the emergency due to sudeden onset of palpitations and chest tightness 

His other medical problems include hypertension, grout and type 2 diabete. cardiac monitoring atrial fibrillation at a rate of 120-140/min. His initial blood pressure is 112/70 and o2 sat of 92. as the nurse is attempting to testablish IV access, the patient becomes unresponsive. there is no palpable pulse over the carotids or femoral arteries, and he has agonal breathing. the cardiac monitor still shows afib at the same rate. which of the following is the bast next step? 

1. ABG 
2. chest compressions (c)
3. defibrillation 
4. IV lidocaine 
5. synchronized cardioversion 

"Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is the presence of an organized rhythm (afib in this patient) on cardiac monitoring without a palpable pulse (or measurable blood pressure) in a cardiac arrest patient. the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) guidelines recommend managing PEA with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and vasopressor (epinephrine) to achieve adequate cerebral and coronary perfusion. CPR should be continues while attempts are made to identify and treat the reversible causes of PEA"

"PEA, a nonperfusing rhythm simila to asystole, is NOT a shockable rhythm
therefore, there is no role for defibrillation or synchronized cardioversion in patients with PEA or asystole 
- defibrillaiton delivers energy randlomy during the cardiac cycle without synchronization to the QRS complex. in cases of cardiac arrest, defibrillation is used in patient with ventricular fibrillation. it is also used in patients with pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), which, despite also being a nonperfusing rhythm, does require defibrillation (by contrast to PEA/asystole, which does not)
- synchronized cardioversion delivers energy synchronized to the QRS compex. it is used in symptomatic or sustain monomorphic CT (unresponsive to antiarrhythmics) and hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular respose. However, if teh patient develops PEA (as in this case) or asystole, ACLS guidelines should be followed"
