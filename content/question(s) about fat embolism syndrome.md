a 26 year old man with a history of seizure disorder and medication nonadherence is hospitalized after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

a witness reports that the patient lost consciousness and fell of a 15 foot ladder onto his right side; the seizure lasted about two minutes. evaluation in the emergency department reveals a low serum level of prescribed antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, and a displaced right femur fracture. no other injuries or laboratory abnormalities are present. levetiracetam is restarted and he undergoes intrameduallary nailing of the fracture with no intraoperative complications. the next day the patient is noted to be confused. temp is 37.2 C or 99F, blood pressure is 142/86, HR 102, and rep is 28. O2 sat is 90% on room air. on p/e he is disoriented but has no focal weakeness of sensory loss/ there is no rash or hematoma at the surgical site. the remainder of the exmination shows no abnormalities. labs:

>Na 136 
>bicarbonate 24

CT pulmonary angiography shows bilateral scattered ground-glass opacities but no filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature. which of the follwoing is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition? 

1. aspiration pneumonitis (17%)
2. cardiogenic pulmonary edema (4%)
3. drug-induced hypersensitivity rxn (8%)
4. fat embolism syndrome (43%)
5. pulmonary contusion (25%)

[[Fat embolism syndrome]] 

etiology 
- fractures of marrow-containing bones (femur, pelvis)
- orthopedic procedures 
- pancreatitis 
- sickle cell disease 

clinical presentation 
* onset ~24-72 hr following inciting event 
* classic triad of:
* Respiratory distress (>90%): Hypoxemia, dyspnea, tachypnea 
* Neurologic dysfunction (>50%): altered mentation, seizures 
* Petecial rash (<50%): head, trunk, subconjunctiva 

diagnosis 
- is based on clinical presentation 

prevention and treatment 
- early fracture immobilizaitona nd fixation 
- supportive care 

this patient most likely has fat embolism syndrome (FES). the condition can occur 24-72 hours following fracture or surgical manipulation of bones that contain abundant marrow (femur, pelvis). the marrow, consisting of fat and hematopoietic cells, embolizes into the venous circulation and can cause physical obstruction in the pulmonary capillaries. some of the emboli may pass through the pulmonary circulation to cause microvascular occlusion in the systemic circulation (brain, dermal capillaries etc.). the circulating fat globules likely also induce a systemic inflammatory response that further contributes to microvascular dysfunction. 

patients with FES classically have the triad of respiratory distress (tachypnea, hypoxemia, dyspnea), nuerologic dysfunction (confusion), and a __petechial rash__; however, the rash is present in less than half of the cases. thrombocytopenia may occur due to platelet adherence and aggregation to circulating fat globules. patients typically develop pulmonary edema (mimicking acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) after 24-48 hours, seen in this patient by bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen because the emboli obstruct the pulmonary capillaries and are too small to be detected on CT scan 

*Aspiration pneumonitis* is a chemical irritation of the lung parenchyma that can lead to ARDS and respiratory failure. It can occur in patients with periods of impaired consciousness (seizures), but it is less likely in the absence of fever and leukocytosis. thrombocytopenia would be unusual as well 

_Cardiogenic pulmonary edema_ would explain this patinet's respiratory distress; however, it would not explain the confusion unless cardiogenic shock is present. this patient's lack of hypotension rules out shock. 

_Drug-induced hypersensitivity_ in the form of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is most commonly seen with certain antiepileptic medications (lamotrigine, carbamezepine); however, levetiracetam is not a common culprit. patient may have respiratory distress and confusion due to systemic organ involvement, but a macular rash is also expected because it is the **most common manifestation of DRESS**. 

_Pulmonary contusion_ results from chest trauma and involves localized pulmonary edema at the site of injury. the edema can take approximately 24 hours from the time of injury to develop; however, it is not expected to occur in a diffuse, scattered pattern, as in this patient

QID 3302

21 year old hospitalized man is evaluated for confusion 

the patient was admitted 2 days ago after an all-terrain vehicle rolled on top of him. he frequenctly binge drinks alcohol and was drinking just prior to the incident. the patient has a right femoral midshaft fracture and right metatarsal fractures. he underwent operative fixation of the femoral fracture and received IV fluids and a blood transfusion. cast immobilization of the metatarsal fractures was also perforemd. 

temp is 37.7, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 120 and resps are 24. o2 is 90% and improves to 9% on 2L. the patient is restless, agitated, and confused. breath sounds are normal and equal in both lungs. cardiac auscultation is normal except for tachycardia. the abdomen is soft and nondistended. new left arm weakness is noted. 

which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's neurologic condition? 

1. alcohol withdrawal 
2. carotid dissection 
3. cerebral embolism (c)
4. cerebral hemorrhage 
5. cerebral vasospasm 
6. diffuse axonal injury
