a 29 year old G2 p0 a1 comes tot he office for a follow-up prenatal visit and to discuss recent test results. she previously had regular menses every 28 days and is at 18 weeks gestation based on her last menstrual period and physical examination. the patient had a first trimester miscarriage during her prior pregnancy. she has no other medical conditions. the patient is taking prenatal vitamins and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. prepregnancy bmi was 22, and she has gained 3 kg in pregnancy. vital signs and physical is normal. the uterus is soft and palpable just below the umbilicus. the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level obtained last week is significantly elevated. which of the following is the most likely abnormality associated with this finding? 

1. fetal abdominal wall defect (c)
2. fetal cardiac anomaly 
3. maternal hepatic neoplasm 
4. meiotic hepatic neoplasm 
5. meiotic nondisjunction of fetal chromosome 18 
6. multiple gestation 
7. robertsonian translocation involving fetal chromosome 21

alpfa-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced by the fetal liver and gastrointestinal tract and is present in fetal serum and amniotic fluid. it is absorbed into the maternal circulation and is measurable as maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). MSAFP is one of the 4 markers (which are MSAFP, unconjugated estriol, beta hcg, inhibin A) comprising the quadruple marker test, a screening test for fetal aneuploidy and congenital defects. 

elevated MSAFP levels commonly occur with: 

1. multiple gestation pregnancies (due to greater fetal tissue volume capable o fproducing AFP) 
2. inaccurate pregnancy dating (because MSAFP fluctuates with gestational age)

however, in patients with a singleton pregnancy and reasonably accurate pregnancy dating -- such as this patient whose last menstrual period is consistent with fundal height (example: just below the umbilicus at 18 weeks gestation) -- an elevated MSAFP suggests a congenital defect 

associatated fetal anomalies include abnormal wall defects (gastroschisis, omphalocele) and open neural tube defects (anencephaly, myelomeningocele). these defects allow for greater leakage of AFP into the amniotic fluid, which elevates MSAFP levels. further evaluation is with an ultrasound to evaluate fetal anatomy and confirm pregnancy dating. 

(choice 2) unlike fetal abdominal wall defects, fetal cardiac anomalies do not increase MSAFP levels because AFP is not produced in fetal cardiac tissue 

(choice 3) elevated levels of AFP can be seen with liver disease (like hepatocellular carcinoma, viral hepatitis) and ovarian germ cell tumors (like endodermal sinus tumors, embryonal carcinoma). This patient has no symptoms of liver disease (example: ascites, jaundice) or of an ovarian germ cell tumor (example, abdominal distention and pain), making a fetal etiology more likely

(genetic choices) trisomy 21 (ecample, due to Robertsonia translocation) produces a classic pattern of abnomrla marker levels: MSAFP and unconjugated estriol, which are fetal tissue products, are decreased (possibly die to suboptimal fetal tissue function). Beta hCG and inhibin A, which are placental secretory products, are increased (possibly due to compensatory placental hyperfunction). trisomy 18 (due to meiotic nondisjunction) is similaryly associated with decreased MSAFP levels and unconjugated estriol, but typically leads to low beta-hcg and normal inhibin A levels (possibly due to lack of compensatory placental hyperfunction)

What does high MSAFP screening indicate? 
an open neural tube defect (example, anencephaly, open spina bifida)
ventral wall defects (omphalocele, gastroschisis)
multiple gestation 

low MSAFP on screen? 
aneuploidies (like trisomy 18 and 21)
