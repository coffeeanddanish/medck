a 17 year old female patient presents to your clinic because she has never had her period. 

she has had normal breast development since the age of 13 as well as axillary hair for the last four years. her past medical history is otherwise normal. the patient has never been hospitalized and is currently not taking any medications. regarding her sexual history, she has tried to have sex several times with her boyfriend, but she would always complain of severe pain and was unable to tolerate any penetration. 

she is 177 cm tall and weights 68 kg. vitals show temp of 36.8, blood pressure is 125/75 and pulse is 74 with regular rhythm. her resp. is 13. her breasts are Tanner stage 4. her axillary hair and pubic hair are sparse. An imperforate hymen is found with otherwise normal genitalia. abdominal exam is normal. 

q1 what is the next best step of management of this patient? (1)

1. 24-hour usrine cortisol level measurement 
2. karyotyping with genetic counseling referral 
3. MRI brain 
4. pelvic ultrasound (Y)
5. progesterone challenge test 
6. psychiatric evaluation 
7. reassurance, as the physical exam is normal 
8. serum FSH/LH 
9. serum GH 
10. serum prolactin 

q2. Based on the test results, you decide to order karyotyping for this patient, whcih returns as 46XY. Which of the following should you consider regarding counseling, future management, and prognosis of this patient? (4)

1. because her uterus is absent, eggs can be harvested from her ovaries, and she could have a child by using IVF and a surrogate for pregnancy 
2. her gonads should be removed because of the high-risk of malignant transformation (Y)
3. referral to a genetic counselor may be warranted (Y)
4. she has vaginismus, and she needs relaxation techniques and kegel exercises to have sex 
5. she needs to take birth control pills to be sure not to get pregnancy 
6. she should start to take testosterone injections 
7. she would not be able to get pregnant (Y)
8. her disease is due to insensitivity to testosterone (Y)

Detailed explanation 

Primary amenorrhea is failure of menses to occur by either age 16 or 2 years after onset of puberty OR age 14 without puberty. Puberty is things like growth spurt, development of secondary suxual characteristics etc. Amenorrhea is usually classified as anovulatory or ovulatory. each type has many cases, but overall, the most common causes of [[amenorrhea - delete]] are  
- pregnancy
- constitutional delay of puberty 
- functional hypothalamic anovulation (stress, eating disorder)
- drugs (OCP, depoprogesterone, antidepressants, antipsychotics) 
- breastfeeding 
- PCOS

*remember due to imperforate hymen, pregnancy testing is skipped as first step*

Rationale for q1 

- karyotyping is very helpful but not before the pelvic ultrasound 
- a progesterone challenege test would be correct. but with an imperforate hymen, we will never know if she is bleeding or not, because the vaginal outflow is blocked 
- FSH/LH leves are useful in dx premature ovarian failure (which is unlikely in this patient)
- MRI brain and prolactin serum level are not helpful (if you're thinking of prolactinoma). Prolactinoma usually presents by secondary amenorrhea, galactorrhea, visual disturbances (ie tunnel vision which is bitemporal hemianopsia), headaches and decreased libido
- GH level makes no sense. Gigantism features include: tall stature, coarse features, bulky extermities, hyperglycemia, hypertension...
- 24-hour urine cortisol level measurement is not appropriate for this patient at this moment. Features of cushing's syndrome are central obesity, buffalo hump, moon facies, proximal muscle weakness, easy bruising, psychiatric disturbances, impaired blood glucose, hypertension, and other symptoms of excess cortisol in the body
- reassurance is inappropriate for a serious genetic and hormonal problem 
- psych referral is not needed 

Rationale for q2 

Testicular feminization syndrome, aka complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is a genetic disorder that makes XY fetuses insensitive (unresponsive) to androgens. instead, they are born looking externally like 'normal girls'. internally, there is a short blind puch vagina and no uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. there are testes in the abdomen or the inguinal canal 

management consists of appropriate counselling regarding fertility, and long term use of HRT needs to be discussed. Reconstructive surgery to xternal genitalia is not needed, but gonads need to be removed due to risk of malignancy. when a woman is diag. with CAIS, referral to a genetic counselor may be warranted to explain the implications of the X-linked recessive inheritance.
