68 yo man comes to the office due to right knee pain and swelling 

3 days a go the patient spent most of the day on his knees while replacing his kitchen floor. the next day, the right knee because increasingly red and painful. medical hisotry included hypertension and type 2 dm. temp is 37, bo is 130/80, pulse is 92. on examination, erythema and warmth are present at the anterior right knee. palpation demonstrates 5-cm tender, fluctuant area of swelling just anterior to the patella. range of motion of the knee is intact but produces mild pain at the end-range of flexion and extension. pedal pulses are 2+ and sensation in the lower extremitites is inctact. gait is normal. which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient? 

1. aspiration of the bursal fluid (c)
2. aspiration of the knee joint 
3. empiric colchicine therapy 
4. knee compression and wrap and ice pack 
5. x-ray of the knee 

[[septic bursitis]]
risk factors 
local cellulitis, abrasions, or penetrating trauam 
bursal instrumentation or injection, prior bursal inflmmation 
immmunocompromised state 

presentation 
painful, localized bursal swelling with erythema and warmth 
w/w/o fever, chills, myalgias 

diagnosis 
consider diagnostic aspiration of bursal fluid 
consider x-ray (for suspected fracture, foreign body or osteomyelitis)

treatment 
systemic antibiotics 
drainage in select areas 

infection ofthe bursa can occur due to 
-superficial abrasions (like working while kneeling)
-penetrating trauma 
-as extension of cellulitis (local)

grampositive skin flora (eg., staphylococcus aureus) a
they account for most cases and the risk is greater in patients with immunocomprimising conditions (DM)



-- 

septic bursitis is chara. by boggy swelling of the bursa, erythema, warmth and pain, fever in 40% and less likely >65 years. 

aspiration of bursal sluid can be performed to differentiate septic from sterile (noninfectious) bursitis, the fluid should be sent for cell count, gram stain, culture, crystal analysis. treatemnet include systemic antibiotics, drainage is indicated when the bursitis fails to improve afterseveral days of antibiotic therapy

other choices: 

2. aspiration of kneejoint: knee joint, rather than bursal fluid, aspiration is indicated for suspected septic arthritis, which typically presents with more diffuse (vs localized prepatellar) swelling, and severely painful, reduced range of motion. _this patient  has intact range of motion_
3. empiric colchicine theraoy - gout (which is treated with colchizine) can cause an inflammatory bursitis resembling septic bursitis, and bursal fluid is often sent for crystal analysis and microbiologic studies. however, infection should be ruled out (eg with bursal fluid aspiration and analysis before a diagnosis of gout is presumed)
4. knee compression wrap and ice application are used to treat noninfectious bursitis due to overuse. noninfectious bursitis is sometimes challenging to differentiate. erythema and warmth could = septic bursa
5. knee xray - may show nonspecific bursal swelling but does not help differentitate septic from sterile bursitis. x-ray is most helpful if a concurrent fracture (due to fall) or a foreign body is suspected.
