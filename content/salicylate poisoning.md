a mother finds her 4 year old son sitting dazed in his grandmother's room. 

he is pale, sweaty and complains of feeling sick and hearing a funny sound in his ears. he is breathing rapidly, then vomits, and becomes unconscious. the vomitus contains some tablets, and the mother notices a half-empty bottle of aspirin by the side of his grandmother's handbag, which is nearby. the mother rushes his to you, the local family physician, and explains that it appears as though her boy has swallowed his grandmother's arthritis medication 

on arrival at your practice, a rapid assessment is undertaken. the mother assures you that the child was quite well earlier that day. examination confirms the mother's findings. there are no other significant clinical findings.

answer 1 
assessing salicylate poisoning - clinical evaluation: 
- mild (150 mg/kg) will cause nausea and vomiting, dizziness, diaphoresis
- moderate (150-300 mg/kg) nause and vomiting, tinnitus, headache, diaphoresis, confusion, hyperventilation, tachycardia, fever 
- severe (300-500 mg/kg) - delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma, respiratory arrest 

coma, convulsion, delirium, hallucinations and respiratory arrest choices are incorrect because there are associated with severe salicylate poisoning.

hypotension, rather than hypertension may be a cardivoascular symptom of salicylate poisoning 

the acid-base and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities seen with salicylate toxicity can be grouped into phases as follows: 

- phase 1 of the toxicitiy is characterized by hyperventilation, resulting from direct respiratory center stimulation, leading to respiratory alkalosis and conpensatory alkaluria. both potassium and sodium bicarbonate are excreted in the urine. this phase may last as long as 12 hours.
- in phase 2, paradoxic aciduria, in the presence of continued respiratory alkalosis occurs when sufficient potassium has been lost from the kidneys. this phase may begin within hours and may last 12-24 hours 
- phase 3 includes dehydration, hypokalemia, and progressive metabolic acidosis. this phase may begin 4-6 hours after ingestion in a young infant or 24 hours or more after ingestion in an adolescent or adult 

anser to q2 
the most important lab evaluation of the child with salicylate intoxication is the measurement of the initial and serial plasma salicylate concentration. additional tests are essential in evaluating the severeity of intoxication 
- arterial or venous blood gas, to evaluate for the presence of acid-base disturbances 
- electrolytes and glucose and urinalysis to obtain baseline measurements which will help follow to monitor success of alkalinization 
- plasma creatinine to evaluate for renal failure, an indication for hemodialysis 

wrong answers:
- blood culture is indicated in case of, for instance, sepsis
- CRP and ESR are acute phase reactants that have no role in the avluation of antibody (humoral) deficiencies 
- LFT are not part of the initial evaluation of salicylate poisoning. liver injury from high doses of aspirin is usually mild and self-limited. liver function test would be included in the initial workup of suspected acetaminophen poisoning 

answer to q3 
no specific antidote for salicylate poisoning is available. therapy is focussed on immediate resuscitation, correction of volume depetion and metabolic derangement, GI tract decontamination, and reduciton of the body's salicylate burden 

gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal is started as soon as possible and if bowel sounds are present, may be repeated ever 4 hours until charcoal appears in the stool. for the patient presenting within 1 to 2 hours who has ingested greater than 150 mg/kg of apiring, give 25 g of charcial in water to a child and 50-100 to a teenager (~1 g/kg)

after volume and electrolyte abnormalities are corrected, alkaline diuresis with sodium bicarbonate infusion can be used to achieve a urine ph of >7.5. alkaline diuresis is indicated for patients with any symptoms of poisoning and should not be delayed until salicylate levels are determined. this intervention is safe and exponentially increases salicylate excretion. 

hemodialysis may be required to enjance salicylate elimination in patient siwth severe neurologic impairment, renal or respiratory insufficiency, acidemia despite otehr measures, or very high serum salicylate levels (of over 100mg/dL which is >7.25 mmol/L) with acute overdose or >6omg/dL which is >4.35mmol/L with chronic overdose

freq. lab monitoring is necessary

wrong asnwers: 
- administration of acetazolamide would be contraindicated because it produces alkaline urine by causing renal elimination of bicarbonate, decreases blood pH and worsens metabolic acidosis that is dangerous in patients with salicylate poisoning 
- forced diuresis should not be performed in addition to being less effective than urinary alkalinization, it may cause fluid overload, rasing the risk of pulmonary or cerebral edema 
- intubation of patient swith salicylate poisoning is dangerous and should be avoided 
- administration of n-acetylcystiene is employed in the treatment of acetominophen poisoning 
- naloxone is utilized in th etreatment of opioid overdose 
- sorbitol with every repeated dose of activated charcoal is incorrect. sorbitol should be given only with the first dose of activated charcoal. multiple doses of sorbitol may lead to profound dehydration and life-threatening hypernatremia 
- whole bowel irrigation can be considered in patients presenting later than two hours after ingestion of sustained-release or enteric-coated drugs when activated charcoal is less effective
