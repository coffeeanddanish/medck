65 yo man comes to the office for evaluation of new-onset pain in the right knee 

the patient first noticed the pain 3 weeks ago after a long hike in the mountains. th epain has not improved with acetaminophen, and he is now unable to sleep because of it. he has also had intermittent low-grade fevers. 

the patient has paget disease of bone, which was diagnosed 10 years ago, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. he drinks alcohol socially but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. temperature is 37.2, bp 120/70, pulse is 80, bmi 23. 

the right knee had diffuse soft tissue swelling and a small effusion with no surrounding erythema. the distal aspect of the thigh is tender to palpation. x-ray of the right knee reveals medullary and cortical bone destruction with lucent areas and surrounding periosteal elevation along the distal femur. 

which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's knee pain? 

1. borrelia burgdorferi-induced monoarticular arthritis 
2. destruction and inflammation of articular cartilage 
3. formation of stress-related microfractures 
4. malignant proliferation of osteoid sarcomatous stroma (c)
5. precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals

[[paget disease of bone]]

"this patient with paget disease of bone now has a destructive femoral lesion, raising strong suspicious for osteosarcoma. most cases occur in a bimodal distribution, as follows: 

- in children and adolsc. osteosarcoma usually develops at the metaphysis of long bones, where cellular turnover is high (primary osteosarcoma)
- in adults age >40, osteosarcoma usuallydevelops at sites of damaged bone, particularly due to Paget disease of bone, irradiaiton, or prior benign bone tumor (secondary osteosarcoma)"

Paget disease of bone is associated wtih increased bone remodelling and bone overgrowth. although most cases are asymptomatic, the risk of osteogenic sarcomatous transformation (at sites of bone overgrowth) is several thousand times greater than the general population. 

manifestations of malignant transformation generally include worsened localized pain and soft tissue swelling.

imaging usually shows a destructive bone lesion with a mixture of radiodense and radioluscent areas, a sunburst periosteal pattern, and/or Codman triangle (periosteal elevation). //adults who develop osteosarcoma have a poor prognosis//
