a healthy looking 23-year-old recently married woman consults you about a new problem. as she takes her seat, she places a plastic container with a small sample of obviously blood-stained urine on the desk, which she says she passed about one hour ago 

she tells you "i've got cystitis again. can you give me some antibiotics?" she has had one previous presentation of cystitis after returning from her honeymoon. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. 

q1: which of the following are NOT ***commonly*** related to presentations of cystitis? 

1. frequency 
2. burning 
3. vomiting [N]
4. abdominal pain 
5. back pain 
6. tuberculosis [N] 
7. sexual activity 
8. history of kidney stones 
9. chlamydia [N]
10. feverish 
11. pregnancy {i}
12. diarrhea [N]
13. diaphragm for birth control 
14. duration of symptoms 
15. hematuria 
16. bacterial infection 
17. blood in urine 

the correct answers for UNCOMMON associations to cystitis are marked [N] which is vomiting, tuberculosis, chlamydia and diarrhea. I got all of them right, except I did not choose chlamydia and pregnancy was the wrong answer. 

q2: which of the following are NOT correct related to this presesntation? 

1. she is likely to have simple cystitis 
2. she may have an underlying problem 
3. all signs and symptoms lead to the diagnosis of urethritis [N]
4. you need to evaluate the possibility of underlying problems 
5. she has not had the underlying infection remedied because she has presented again with the same problem [N]
6. she has had a recurrence of the same problem 
7. you need to look at preventive issues at this presentation 
8. she does not need counselling regarding sexual hygiene [N]
9. she needs support and reassurance 
10. you should postpone antibiotic therapy until test results become available [N]
11. order culture and antibiotic sensitivity test 
12. her new presentation of cystitis will likely resolve again with antibiotic therapy 
13. pyelonephritis commonly complicates treated cases of cystitis [N]
14. you should consider pregnancy as a possible cause
15. you and the patient should develop a management plan 
16. you should discuss the diagnosis and cause with the patient 
17. you should give her take-away patient information 
18. you should arrange follow up if further episodes occur 

Correct answers (marked with [N] for no = not correct related to this presentation) are that these s/s are of urethritis, the fact that her past infection was not remedied (I don't understand this one); she does not need sexual hygiene is also wrong, she should wait for results to take abx, pyelonephritis is a common complication assc. with this (is it or is it not? I need to clarify)

Detailed explanation~ 

Regardless of the etiology of cystitis, it is generally characterized by a triad of symptoms, including pelvic pain, dysuria, and micturation of a frequency such that the patient voids every 15-20 minutes. In some cases, hematuria, dyspareunia, abdominal cramps, and/or bladder pain and spasms may also be present. 

Assc. systemic manifestations include fever, chills, and general malaise, though systemic manifestations with a bladder infection are unusual. Local bladder symptoms may be disturbing, but more importantly, these symptoms may precede acute pyelonephritis. it is also important to remember that cystitis may result from an underlying structural bladder abnormality, such as a neurogenic bladder, bladder outlet obstruction, calculi, tumor, or cystocele. these primary causes need to be corrected before resolution of the cystitis is possible. 

cystitis occurs more often in women than in men, because the urethra in women is shorter. this makes it easier for bacteria to ascend into the female bladder. women who are sexually active, who use diaphragms for birth control, and/or are _past_ menopause are at an increased risk for cystitis caused by a UTI 

certain other populations are also at a higher risk for developing cystitis. they include the elderly and people with a history of kidney stones, kidney disease, or chronic conditions like HIV/AIDS and diabetes. people who have an indwelling catheter in their bladder are also at risk. 

tuberculous cystitis is usually secondary to renal tuberculosis. 

in both sexes, the most common causative organism is the coliform bacteria E. coli.; other common causative organisms are Klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, and strep. faecalis (PESKy)

in patients with a neurogenic bladder or with a long-standing indwelling catheter, mixed organisms, including pseudomonas organisms, and other spp. of streptococci, are commonly found. rare causes include herpes virus, chlamydia spp., N. gonorrhea 

the test most commonly cosidered at this stage is a _culture and antibiotic sensitivity test_. experience shows that the patient's problem is likely to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy and she may well be symptom-free, or at least much improved, prior to test results becoming available. 

in this common problem many physicians order this test only if 1) there is no clinical improvement after a few days, 2) if pyuria or hematuria fails to clear or 3) someother reason co-exists example diabetes. the presence of hematuria on the other hand, indicats the presence of significant inflammation which arguably might strongly indicate the need for urine culture. 

this is an interesting clinical challenge as one has to balance the increasing community trend to litigation and a percieved need by the doctor to address this, that is, to practice 'defensive medicine'. a more scientific approach looks at cost benefits and risk factors rather than 'routine' pathology tests. unfortunately, the trend to 'defensive medicine' is often regarded as 'scientific' when it really means 'common practice'

Urethritis: 

symptoms of suprapubic discomfort and frequency suggest a bladder infection and hematuria is more likely with cystitis than with infection localised to the urethra 

Cystitis: 

this is the common site of inflammation causing frequency and scalding. in most cases, visible hematuria is absent but present on microscopy. in a young female, by far the commonest cause of this problem is a UTI localized to the bladder. it is quite rare in males 

Pyelonephritis 

When the UTI is mainly affecting the kidney the general symptoms are usually quite severe (fever, generally unwell, anorexia, etc.) and there is usually loin and (?) back pain. there may be radiation from loin to groin and sometimes renal colic (clot colic). this is not a common problem and rarely complicates treated cases of cystitis 

Pregnancy with UTI 

cystitis commonly complicates pregnancy, and in this case, the possibility needs to be considered. the history of amenorrhea and assc. symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and breast tenderness may further suggest this possibility. pregnancy tests using blood or urine are easily performed and very accurate.
