a 67 year old woman sees you in your office because of involuntary urinary loss during the day. she also complains about sudden and abrupt urges to void which she describes as "she's got to go this second she would never be able to hold it." What make her circumstance most frustrating is that she has to get up every night 2-3 times to go to the bathroom and she is exhausted by the the sleep deprivation, since most of the times she is unable to go back to sleep. the patient also adds, that whenever she is coudhing, laughing , sneezing or climbing stairs, she experiences urine leakage. to deal with this problem she already use two or three sanitary napkins a day 

Her menopause commenced 15 years ago with mood changes, hair loss, and sweating. after 2 years the symptoms ceased, and she says that she never had any problem since. her past surgical history reveals three uneventful vaginal deliveries at the age of 23, 25, 26 and well-controlled hypertenion (CCB). Her family history is positive for diabetes, IHD, and colon cancer. her BMI is 31 and she smokes one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. 

Her BP upon examinaiton is 125/85 mmHG and her pulse is 76 and regular. the urinalysis the nurse conducted on arrival is negative for leukocytes, glucose, and nitrites. 

q1: what are the best steps in the evaluation of this patient's condition? (upto 7 years)

1. a. abdominal hysteroscopy 
2. b. abdominal ultrasound [Y] {i}
3. c. continence pessary 
4. d. creatinine [Y]
5. e. indwelling urinary catheter 
6. f. multichannel urodynamics [Y] 
7. g. pelvic examination [Y] {i}
8. h. post-void residual volume [Y] {i}
9. i. psychiatric consultation 
10. j. suprapubic catheter 
11. k. thorough history [Y]
12. l. urine culture [I] {i}
13. m. urine sendiment 
14. n. vaginal hysterectomy 
15. o. vaginal pessary 
16. p. vitamin B12 level [Y]

q2: before you conduct a thorough physical examination, you advise the patient to lose weight and quit smoking. On examination, you establish the diagnosis of a first-degree cystocele, a first-degree uterovaginal prolapse, and small rectocele. 

Which of the following are possible treatment options for this condition? (upto 7 answers)

1. abdominal hysterectomy is indicated 
2. advice the patient to purchase geriatric diapers 
3. injection of periurethral bulking agents is an alternative in young child-bearing women 
4. in patients with overactive bladder, a psychological assessment is always indicated 
5. pelvice exercise / kegel exercise is not indicated for this patient's problem 
6. prescribe estrogen ointment 
7. referral to a urogynecologist is indicated 
8. suggest Burch procedure 
9. suggest marshall-marchetti-krantz procedure 
10. suggest sling repair (Aldrich procedure)
11. suggest tension free tape 
12. tell the patient that these changes are a part of normal aging process. follow up in 6 months 
13. the patient most likely has atrophic urethritis and vaginitis 
14. trial of oral antispasmodics for her overactive bladder 
15. vaginal hysterectomy is the definitive treatment 

Correct answers are estrogen ointment, referral, Burch procedure, Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure, Aldrich procedure, tension free tape and a trial of oral antispasmodics for her overactive bladder 

q3: the patient is very worried, now that knows her treatment options. she asks you what could cause her condition, what preventive measures could she tak and what is the likelihood of complications. she also wants to know the way the urinary incontinences and the pelvic weakness are connected. which of the follwoing statements should you include in this discussion?

7. the likelihood of improvement after management is low 
8. the likelihood of improvement after surgical management is about 60-70% [A]

14. urinary incontinence affects at least 9% of the women btw 15-64 years [A]
15. urinary inconctinence affects more caucasian women than african-american 

[A] is acceptable answer, the one wrong answer I chose was 15-64 years 19%, whereas it is 9% 

detailed explanation~ 

this patient is presenting with mixed urinary incontinence. she has symptoms of stress (leakage while sneezing and coughing) and urge (urge to void which cannot be suppressed) incontinence, which is quite common in her age group. the cause of her condition is still unclear, that is why further investigation is indicated 

1. abdominal ultrasound to assess bladder and kidneys, and to get a post void residual volume of the bladder 
2. abdominal hysteroscopy is not indicated 
3. continence pesary could be a conservative treatment option, but would not help in the evaluation of this patient 
4. creatinine should be definitely considered since the kidneys could be affected in a long-standing voiding issue 
5. indweling urinary catheter would neither help in the investigation nor in the treatment 
6. multichannel urodynamics need to be performed and is this gold standard in the evaluaiton of urinary incontinence (a well-catalogued diary of evenets can be a good substitute for urodynamic studies)
7. pelvic examination cannot be missed since it gives information about eventual pelvic relaxation and prolapse, which are common causes for stress incontinence 
8. post-void residual volume can be a clue in urge incontinence because the bladder is not emptying properly. only if the volume is more than 50 mL, it is pathologic 
9. psychiatric consultation is not indicated because the patient describes the classic symptoms of urinary incontinence and presents with the classic risk factors for stress incontinence like obesity, vaginal delivery, age and smoking 
10. suprapubic catheter would be malpractice 
11. thorough history gives you most of the time the most important clues in a clinical setting for the patient's condition 
12. urine culture and urine sediment are indicated to rule out infection which can be a cause. women that age often present with asymptomatic bacteriuria. a urinalysis should be performed in all patients, and urine culture performed if.a UTI is suggested on screening. therefore in this specific patient, it is not needed 
13. urine sediment - see above
14. vaginal hysterectomy does not help in evaluation, might be indicated in patients with third-degree prolapse 
15. vaginal pessary is a conservative treatment option in very friable patients 
16. if the vitamin b12 is low, it could be a cause for urinary incontinence in terms of neurologic isssues 

q2 explanation 

while local estrogens may help with some urinary symptoms, as might oral HRT, it is unlikely that the patient's symptoms would be cured by this simple measure. a short trial for 4 weeks may be indicated. while it is worthwhile excluding a UTI, there are other ways this patient can be helped. urinary problems like this might very well restrict the patient's daily activity and significantly affect her social interactions 

antispasmodics such as oxybutynin may help with the urgency and frequency, but it is unlikely to cure patient's problems of stress incontinenece. a short trial may be indicated. while she does have a mild degree of prolapse, it is probably no worse than the averag post-menopausal woman who has had a couple of children. a vaginal hysterectomy and repair is a significant operation and is unlikely to improve her urinary symptoms on its own. in a complicated situation which appears to be both urgen-stress incontinence mixed together, urodynamic investigation is certainly indicated.

- abdominal hysterectomy might be indicated in a third or fourth degree uterine prolapse, in this patient it is not and would not bring relief from the urinary incontinence 
- advice the patient to purchace geriatric diapers. the patient already wears napkins for her protection; diapers would not solve the problem 
- injection of periurethral bulking agents is an alternative in elderly and friable women who have already undergone surgical treatment for incontinence 
- in patients with overactive bladder a psychological seessment is not indicated since the etioogy is, in fact, idiopathic, but definitely not caused by psychological problems 
- pelvic or Kegel exercises is the best and proven conservative treatment option 
- referral to a urogynecologist is indicated 
- there are a couple of treatment options which need to be evaluated individually, but the following are possible in this case: Burch procedure, Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure (not so common anymore), sling repair (Aldrich procedure), or tension free tape 
- about 9% of women between the age of 15-64 are affected with incontinence. Treatment options for this conditions exists, and it is not necessarily connected to aging
- atrophic urethritis and vaginitis are rather associated with painful urination, spotting, and painful intercourse 
- vaginal hysterectomy is not the gold standard treatment 

q3 explanation 

Lifestyle changes are crucial in the management of mixed, urgent and stress inconctinence 
- weight loss 
- quitting smoking 
- reduced caffience and alcohol intake in urge incontinence 
- in this case, changin the hypertensive medication to a beta blocker might contribute positively, since vasodilators worsen the symptoms of urge incontinence 
- kegel exercises for strengthening the weak pelvic floor has good outcomes beause the most common contributing factor for stress incontinence is weakness of the pelvic floor (with cange of the angle between urethra and bladder) or less common, an intrinsic sphincter deficiency (?) 
- urge incontinence is a result of uninhibited bladder contraction from detrusos hyperactivity. this hyperactivity can be caused by abnormalities of the CNS, inflammation, stones or neoplasms. It can clearly be differentiated from genuine stress incontinence (GSI) on urodynamic studies. it is not the most common contributing factor for incontinence 

Burch colposuspension requries the elevation of the paravaginal tissues to the ipsilateral iliopectoneal ligamient which is attached to the pubic. the procedure can be performed by laparotomy or by using a laparoscopic approach 

marshall-marchetti-krantz procedure is where the paraurethral tissues are elevated to the back of the pubis on both sides by an extraperitoneal laparotomy approach 

a sling opeartion (Aldridge Sling) requires a sling to be passed around the urethra from above, where it is not possible to evaluate the urethra 

a tension free tape approach is used when a synthetic material is placed around the urethra 

surgical management of pelvic relaxation could affect the patient's sexuality, therefore, if surgical repair for example vaginal prolapse is carried out, the surgeon needs to be aware of the wish for ongoing sexual function 

the chance of improvement for most of the surgical procedures previosuly described is about 60-70% with a 5-10% of deterioration and a 20-30% of no change 

stress inconctinence is more prevalent in caucasian women than in african american or hispanic women (41% vs 31% vs 30%, resp.)

the incidence of urge incontinence is similar in all three groups (19% vs 16% vs 16%)

mixed incontinence occurs more often in blacks and caucasian compared to hispanic women (14-15-0.9%)
