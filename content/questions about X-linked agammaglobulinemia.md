a 9 month boy has had repeated lower respiratory tract infections and diarrhea in the past three months. 

recently, he has also developed acute otitis media cause by strep pneumo. family history reveals an uncle who suffered recurrent skin infections and died from pneumonia at age 37. 

the p/e shows very small tonsils. biopsy of lymphoid tissue shows a lack of germinal center, and bone marrow biopsy reveals the absence of plasma cells. what is the best long-term management of this conition? 

1. immunoglobulin infusion (c)
2. symptomatic treatment 
3. bone marrow transplant 
4. aggressive IV abx 
5. splenectomy

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) also known as Bruton agammaglobulinemia, is an inherited immunodeficiency disease due to mutations in the gene coding for bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). In the absence of BTK, B-lymphocytes, antibody producing plasma cells are also absent. on examination, palpable lymph nodes may be very small or absent. the disease is suspected when a male infant repeatedly becomes ill with, most commonly, bacterial respiratory tract infections. IgG levels are less than 100mg/dL support the diag. 

the onset of symptoms after 6 months of age corresponds to the protective action of maternal immunoglobulin G. the boy has small tonsils and no palpable lymph nodes with a lack of germinal center (where mature B-lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation occur). plasma cells, the end-stage of b-cell differentiation, are absent. family history on an uncle suffering from recurrent infections suggests genetic disease. 

no curative therapy exists for XLA. treatment includes an IV infusion of IgG every 3 to 4 weeks for life. the treatment reduces the number and severity of infections. 

bone marrow transplant and splenectomy are not the corrent treatment options for this disease 

antibiotics are a supplementary treatment. local antibiotic treatment (drops, lotions) are preferred over systemic treatemtns (pills) for long-term treatment, if possible 

key point: 
there is no curative therapy x-linked agammaglobulinemia. treatment includes an intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin every 3-4 weeks for life. the treatment reduces the number and severity of infections.

QID 19631

a 15-month old boy is brought to the emergency due to irritability and vomiting 

his parents say that the patient was more tired than usual yesterday and went to bed early. this morning, he awoke crying and has been onconsolable. his mother attempted to feed him, but he has vomited twice today. three weeks ago, the patient had similar symptoms and was admitted to th ehospital and diagnosed with _enteroviral meningitis_. He had a history of 2 episodes of pneumonia requiring hospitalization as an infant. temp is 40C. on examination, the patient is awake but crying and inconsolable in his mother's arms. Heart and lung examinations are unremarkable, and the abdomen is soft. there is diffuse macular rash over th trunk. lumbar puncture results are as follows: 

CSF
glucose 50
protein 80 
leukocytes 300 cells per microliter 
rbc 5 cells per microliter 

gram stain reveals no organisms. the patient is suspected to have chronic viral meningitis. which of the following additional findings is most likely to be found in this patient? 

1. absence of interferon gamma receptors 
2. decreased levels of all immunoglobulins (c)
3. impaired neutrophil oxidative burst 
4. isolated definiciency of IgA 
5. reduced number of peripheral neutrophils {i}

this patient has chronic enteroviral meningitis and recurrent pneumonia, which are features of X-linked agammaglobulinemia. XLA is an immunodeficiency characterized by failure of B-cell maturation in the bone marrow due to defective Bruton tyrosine kinase signaling. B lymphocytes cannot enter circulation, resulting in decreased antibody production and impaired humoral immunity. 

XLA causes recurrent infections in boys during late infancy once maternally derived IgG wanes (age >3-6mo). Sinopulmonary infections are most common and are typically caused by encapsulated bacteria (eg. strep pneumo, H. influenza type B ), which require antibody opsonization for clearance. patients are also predisposed to chronic enteroviral infection (like menigoencephalitis), as seen in this patient, due to lack of antibodies to neutralize the disease. Similarly, prolonged diarrheal illnes (giardia) due to low IgA is more likely in patients with XLA. 

Lab findings of XLA include low CD19+ B-cell concentrations and decreased levels of all immunoglobulins. antibody response to vaccines is also impaired. immunoglobulin replacements therapy is the mainstay of treatment.
