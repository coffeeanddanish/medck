what is transtentorial coning? 

the arrangement of dural folds help stabilize the brain within the cranial cavity. under a focal space-occupying lesion, raised intracranial pressure may cause the brain to herniate under the falx cerebri, or more significantly, through the tentorial notch which can compress the midbrain, vessels and third cranial nerve against the inferomedial surface of the temporal lobe. this process is known as transtentorial coning. 

it poses a risk of secondary arterial compression. 

It is also seen as the terminal event in patients with a supratentorial space occupying lesion.

infratentorial lesions cause either upward herniation through the tentorial hiatus or downward through the foramen magnum
