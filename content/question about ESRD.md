50 yo man comes to the office for a routine follow up visit.

he has hypertension, diabetes, depression, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and end-stage renal disease. the patient has been on hemodialysis for the past 3 years. he was admitted 3 months ago for catheter-related infection, which was treadted with antibiotics. the patient also have a right below the knee amputation 2 yeard ago following a nonhealing foot ulcer. 
p/e shows a right carotid bruit. over the next 5 years, this patient is a greatest risk of death from which of the followin? 

1. cardiovascular ds (c)
2. infection 
3. suicide 
4. venous thromboembolism 
5. voluntary withdrawal of hemodialysis 

cardiovascular risk factors in esrd patients 

traditional risk factors: hypertenison, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, LVH, advanced age and low physical activity 

ESRD risk factor -- anemia of chronic disease, vascular calcifications (inc. phosphorous and increased calcium), oxidative stress related to uremia and dialysis 

in additino, ckd is an independent risk factor for cvs, follwoing likely die tp factors related to renal dysfunction, and/or renal replacement therapy including the following: 

1. metabolic abnormalities (eg. hyperphosphatemia) and increased calcium load (eg., vitamin D supplementation) cause arterial calcification, coronary artery stiffening/ narrowing, and left ventricular hypertrophy (diastolic dysfunction)
2. uremia and renal replacement therapy cause oxidative stress, resulting in accelerated atherogenesis and inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis 
3. anemia, which is common in patients with ESRD, is a risk factor for CVD and is associated worse outcomes in acute coronary syndrome 

CVD also accounts for significant morbidity in patients with ESRD, peripheral artery disease with extensive vascular calcification and poor arterial supply can lead to nonhealing foot ulcers and result in amputation. because of the increased morbidity and mortality, patients with ESRD require aggressive management of both traditional and non-specific cardiovascular risk factors
