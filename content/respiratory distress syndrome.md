Etiology 

the deficiency of surfactant in the lungs causes 'poor' lung complicance due to a high surface tension over the alveoli. this leads to atelctasis or collapse of alveoli. now there is decreased area for gas exchange. this will cause hypoxia and acidosis, leading to repiratory distress. also known as hylaine membrane disease. 

gestational age: preterm baby 

Risk factors 
Maternal diabetes 
Low birth weight
Male 
Second born twin 
Hypothermia 
Acidosis, sepsis 

patient will be in respiratory distress within the first few hours of life, and will worsen over the next 24-72 h. or, 1-3 days will be the danger zone. obviously you will see hypoxia and cyanosis. 

chest x-ray findings 
homogenous inflitrates 
air bronchgrams 
decreased lung volume 
sometimes, may mimic the appearance of a group b strep pneumonia 
if very severe, has a 'white out' appearance where the cardiac borders are undifferentiated 

prevention 
prenatal corticosteroids 
celestone (R) (betamethasone) 12mg bid [[Drugs]]
if you think there is a risk of premature delivery = <34weeks 
monitor the sphingomyelin:lecithin ratio with amniocentesis 
safe ratio is 2:1 - which indicates lung maturity 

treatment: 
resuscitation 
oxygen, ventilation 
surfactant 

complications 
due to prolonged ventilation 
severity of prematurity: 
we can anticipate
bronchopulmonary dysplasia 

prognosis 
dependant upon the GA 
and the severity of the lung condition 
we can anticipate a chronic lung condition long-term
