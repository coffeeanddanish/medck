34 yo woman comes to the office due to excessive urination at night. 

for the past 2 weeks, the patient has been getting up at least 3 times at night to urinate. she has a history of hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine and bipolar disorder treated with lithium carbonate. blood pressure is 134/78, pulse 88, BMI 27. physicial examination shows decreased skin turgor and dry mucous membranes, lab: 

sodium 146
k 4 
chloride 106 
bicarbonate 26 
creat 1.1 
cal 10.0 
gluc 112 

osm. 308 

TSH 7 

urine osm 200

This patient's symptoms are most likely caused by a defect in which of the following sites? 

1. hypothalamus 
2. pancreatic islet cells 
3. posterior pituitary lobe 
4. proximal tubular of the kidney 
5. renal collecting ducts (c)
6. thyroid follicular cells 

the answer is diabetes insipidus due to lithium toxiticy. 

_primary polydipsia_
causes: ADH independent (excessive water intake)
etiology: antipsychotics (dry mouth, psychiatric conditions 
results of water deprivation: high urine osmolality 
response to desmopressive: no change 

_central diabetes insipidus_ 
causes: ADH deficiency (CNS pathology)
etiology: idiopathic, trauma, pituitary surgery, ischemic encephalopathy 
results of water deprivation: low urine osmolality 
response to desmopressin: increased urine osmolality 

_nephrogenic diabetes insipidus_
causes: ADH resistance (renal ds)
etiology: chronic lithium use, hypercalcemia, hereditary (AVPR2 & aquaporin 2 mutations)
results of water deprivation: low urine osmolality 
response to desmopressin: no change 

"this patient with nocturia and persistenly dilute urine (urine osm <300) with overnight fasting likely has lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

normally, adh stimulates renal water reasorption when serum osmolality is high (following water deprivation). ADH resistance or deficiency causes DI, which presents with dilute urine (low urine osmolality) and polyuria (often worse at night)

nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by renal ADH resistance. one of the most common causes in adults is lithium, which accumulates in renal collecting ducts and blocks responsiveness to ADH. after water deprivation (eg, fasting overnight), serum osmolality rises (eg. >295, often with hypernatremia) and ADH increases appropriately; however, urine osmolality remains low

central diabetes insipidus can occur following hypothalamic or postr pituitary damage (eg, trauama, infection) and leads to deficient ADH secretion. after water deprivation, serum osmolality ruses but ADH remains low -- therefore, urine osmolality remains low. lithium use is only rarely associated with central DI"

A desmopressive challenge can differentiate central from nephrogenic DI (as desmopressive causes increased urine osmolality only in central DI)

rationale for wrong answers

1. hypothalamus: Psychogenic polydipsia is classically associated with psychiatric conditions or disorders affecting thirst. polyuria and dilute urine are seen, however, in contrast to diabetes insipidus, they represent appropriate responses to excessive water intake, and both ADH sensitivity and production are intact. therefore, following water deprivation, ADH rises and urine becomes concentrated (ie, urine osmolality icreases >300). this patient's dilute urine following water deprivation makes psychogenic polydypsia unlikely 
2. pancreatic islet cell: pancreatic cell destruction causes type 1 diabetes, severe hyperglycemia can precipitate glucosiuria and associated osmotic diuresis. hwoever, osmotic diuresis is associated with high, rather than low, urine osmolality, and this patient's fasting blood sugar is only mildly elevated 
3. proximal tubule of kidney: SGLT2i are diabetic medications that act ont he proximal tubule of kidney. the patient has no history of SGLT2i and her low urine osmolality makes osmotic diuresis 
4. thyroid follicular cells: this patients elevated TSH suggests suboptimally treated hypothyroidism )possibly from chronic lithium therapy) however, hypothyroidism is not associated with nocturia or persistently dilute urine
