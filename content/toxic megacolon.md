25-30% mortality 
subtotal colectomy w/ possibility of stoma 

toxic megacolon is paralysis of the smooth muscle layer of the colon due to some pathology. usually the plexus is not damaged and the electrolytes are undisturbed. apart from the common infectious pathogens (c diff, e histolytica, cmv, shigella, salmonella, campylobacter), the most common cause if IBD (UC more than crohns)

triggers 
hypokalemia
constipating agents like loperamide 
colonoscopy 
barium enema 

investigations 
CBC, ESR, electrolytes, CRP 
metabolic alkaloses (volume contraction and hypokalemia) are hypoalbunimeia are late findings 

AXR: dilated colon >6 cm (right > transverse > left) and loss of haustra 
CT: severity + underlying complications (like abscess, perforation, ascending phlebitis)

treatment? supportive 

NPO, NG tube, stop constipating agents 
correct fluid and electrolytes 
transfusion maybe (not understood by me)
serial AXR 
broad-spectrum abx (reduce sepsis and anticipate perforation)

aggressive treatment
steroid for IBD 
metronidazole for c diff 

indications for surgery 
50% improvement on medical management 
continuous for 24-72 hours 
severe hemorrhage or perforation 
high lactate, WBC (esp for c diff)
subtotal colectomy + end ileostomy (possibility of re-anastomosis later) 

hirschsprung toxic colitis may also fall under differentials of non-infectious acute diarrhea in pediatrics - as far as lecturio videos go
