1. list and interpret critical clinical findings

	2. the results of an appropriate physical examination notably aimed at assessing the patient's hemodynamic stability 
	3. indications of a high likelihood of rebleeding 
2. list and interpret critical clinical investigations 
	1. endoscopy 
	2. laboratory and diagnostic imaging 
3. construct an effective management plan 
	1. resusciation of the hemodynamically unstable 
	2. medical treatment as appropriate 
	3. employment of endoscopic procedures
