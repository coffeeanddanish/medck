What is should dystocia?
What are the clinical signs of shoulder dystocia? 
What are the complications of the fetus in shoulder dystocia? 
What is the acronym for approach and management? 

shoulder dystocia is a condition where the fetal anterior shoulder is impacted during delivery against the symphysis pubis of the mother. It's most significant sign is the "turtle's sign" which is when the fetal head is retracted. shoulder dystocia is a life-threatening emergency. the neonatal manifestations can be, from most to least alarming: death, cord compression leading to encephalopathy, fracture of the clavicle, humerus or the cervical spine, and injury to the brachial plexus. 

the treatment goal is to displace the anterior shoulder from behind the pubic synphysis. the approach has the acronym: ALARMER: 

A - ask for help 
L - legs in full flexion 'Mcroberts maneuver'
A - anterior should disimpaction by supraoubic pressure 
R - release posterior shoulder by rotating it anteriorly with hand in the vagina under adequate anesthesia 
M - manual corkscrew i.e. rotate the fetus by the posterior shoulder until the anterior shoulder emerges from behind the maternal pubis. 
E - epistotomy ???? 
R - rollover (on hands and knees) 

Suprapubic pressure and the McRoberts manvr. which is legs in full flexion resolve the situation 90% of the time

How to make a question out of ALARMER?

QID 4198 

1-day old boy is evaluated in the nursery for minial right-hand movement. 

he was born at 39 weeks gestation by forceps-assisted, vaginal delivery to a mother with insulin-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus and obesity. The delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia. birth weight was 4.4kh. examiantion of the right upper extremity shows extension of the write, hyperextension of the MCP joints, and flexion of IP joints. Grasp reflex is absent. Moro and biceps reflexes are intact. there is no crepitus. The left arm is normal. There is slight ptosis of the right eyelid. and the right pupil is 2.5 mm smaller than the left. the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation> 

1. fracture of the right clavicle 
2. fracture of the right humerus 
3. injury to the 5th and 6th cervical nerves 
4. injury to the 8th cervical nerve and 1st thoracic nerve (c)
5. preinatal asphyxia
6. perinatal ischemic stroke 

This question's detailed explanation is focussed on brachial plexus injury, but not on the approach. It will require some thinking, as brachial injury is too easy as opposed to the condition and treatment.
