a 78 year old man comes ot the office due to lower extremity swelling 

he has had progressive exertional dyspnea over the past two years. over the past 2 months, the patient has noticed lower extremity swelling, decreased appetitie, and increased abdominal girth. he has a history of poorly controlled hypertension but no known coronary artery disease. the patient is a lifetime smoker. he has no hisotry of prior surgeries. 

blood pressure is 165/88, pule is 72 and regular, he is afebrile. on physical exam the jugular veins are distended and there are prominent v waves. a holosystolic murmur is heard at the lower sternal border, and there is 3+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. which of the following best explains the physical examination findings in this patient? 

1. dilatation of the pulmonary arteries 
2. dilation of the tricuspid valve annulus (c)
3. flailing of a tricuspud valve leaflet 
4. fusion of the tricuspid valve 

This patient with prolonged uncontrolled hypertension and progressive dysnea, lower extremity swelling, and jugular venous distension likely has a decompensated left-sided heart failure due to hypertensinve heart disease. the holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is consistent with tricuspid regurgitation (TR)

an estimated 90% of TR is secondary (functional), defined as that occuring with an anatomically normal tricuspid valve. secondary TR usually results from right ventricular cavity enlargement in the setting of chronic right-sided volume or pressure overload (like right-sided heart failure). left-sided heart failure is a common cause of right ventricle overload. similar to left ventricular enlargement in secondary mitral regurgitation, RV enlargement causes tricuspid annular dilation as well as tethering (increased tension) of the chordae tendinae, both of which restrict adequate closure of normal tricuspid valve leaflets. 

on the jugular venous pulsation (JVP) waveform, prominent V waves are highly specific for TR. The c wave of the JVP waveform occurs at the start of RV contraction and is followed by the x descent as right atrial pressure decreases. the v wave then follows as right atrial pressure increases with atrial refilling. because incompetent tricuspid valve closure leads to a sustained elevation in right atrial pressure during right ventricule systole, TR causes an absent x descent and prominent v wave.
