1. list and interpret critical clinical findings, including
    1. the origin of the abnormal sound and/or murmur; and
    2. results of an appropriate history and physical examination aimed at determining the underlying pathological condition, including severity and complications (e.g., heart failure, endocarditis);
2. list and interpret critical investigations, including
    1. diagnostic screening for cardiac arrhythmia by means of clinical findings and electrocardiogram; and
    2. appropriate diagnostic imaging, including echocardiography, for further investigation of the murmur or abnormal heart sounds; and
3. construct an effective initial management plan, including
    1. initiating management for the underlying condition and its complications (e.g., heart failure, atrial fibrillation, endocarditis);
    2. recommending endocarditis prophylaxis if indicated; and
    3. determining whether the patient requires specialized care.
