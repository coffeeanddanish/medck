treatment of UTI in nonpregnant women 

"uncomplicated UTI: nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, forfomycin (single dose), fluoroquinolones only if previous options cannot be used, urine culture only if initial treatment fails. 
complicated UTI: outpatient: fluoroquinolones 
Inpatient-ceftriaxone, pip-taz, carbapenems (impenem)
culture prior to tx with adjust of abx if neccs."

This patient's clinical presentation of dysuria, urinary frequency, suprapubic tenderness suggests uncomplication UTI. Uncomplicated UTIs are acute infections that are confined within the bladder. in those with uncomplicated UTI, a diag. can be made with urinalysis alone (+leuks and nitrites). 

preferred empiric treatment options include TMPX-SMX for 3 days, nitrofurantoin for five day and fosfomycin one dose. flouroquinolone are also effective but are typically reserved for patients who cannot take the other options due to sulfa allergy or high resistance etc...

what is complicated UTI? it refers to extension of infection beyond the bladder. fever, chills, rigors, ***flank pain, CVA tenderness*** 
Pyelonephritis, infection of the upper urinary tract and kidneys, is also categorized as a complicated UTI. these patients should have a urine culture obtained prior to empiric therapy so anx can be appropriately tailored to ensure appropriate complete therapy.

wrong answers; 

IM ceftraxone with oral doxy is for chlamydia and gonorrhea. presence IUD makes no differencec. doxy is not the best for cystitis 

amoxicillin is assc with high rates of abx resistance. you can consider alox-clav for GI sx
