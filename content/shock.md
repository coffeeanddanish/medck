shock is the final common pathway for several potentially lethal clinical events, including severe hemorrhage, extensive trauma or burns, large myocardial infarction, massive pulmonary embolism, and microbial spesis. shock is characterized by systemic hypotension due either to reduced cardiacoutput or to reduced effectived clirculating blood volume. the consequences are impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia. at the outset, the cellular injury is reversibly, however, prolonged shock eventually leads to irreversible tissue injury that often proves fatal. 

the causes of shock fall into three general categories 

- cardiogenic shock: results from low cardiac output due to myocardial pump failure. this can be due to intrinsic myocardial damage (infarction), ventricular arrhytmias, extrinsic compression (cardiac tamponade) or outflow obstruction (like pulmonary embolism) 
- hypovolemic shock results from low cardiac output due to the loss of blood or plasma volume, such as can occur with massive hemorrhage or fluid loss from severe burns 
- septic shock results from vasodilation and peripheral pooling of blood as part of a systemic immune reaction to bacterial or fungal infection. its complex pathogenesis. 

stages of shock 

shock is a progressive disorder that, if uncorrected, leads to death. the exact mechanisms of death from sepsis are still unclear, aside from increased lymphocyte and enterocyte apoptosis, there is only minimal cell death, and patients rarely have refractory hypotension. for hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, however, the pathways to death are reasonably well understood. unless the insult is massive and rapidly lethal (like a massive hemorrhae from a rupture [[aortic aneurysm]]), shock in those settings tends to evolve through three general phases: 

- initial nonprogressive phase, during which reflex compensatory mechanisms are activated and perfusion of vital organs is maintained 
- a progressive stage characterized by tissue hypoperfusion and onset of worseninig circulatory and metabolic imbalances, including acidosis 
- an irreversible stage that sets in after the body has incurred cellular and tissue injury so severe that even if the hemodynamic defects are corrected, survival is not possible 

in the early nonprogressive phase of shock, a variety of neurohumoral mechanism help to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. these include baroreceptros reflexes, catecholamine release, activation of the RAAS, ADH release, and generalized sympathetic stimulation. the net effect is tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, and renal conservation of fluid. cutaneous vasoconstriction, for example, is responsible for the characterisitc coolness and pallor of the skin in well-developed shock (although septic shock can initially cause cutaneous vasodilation and thus present with warm, flushed skin). Coronary and cerebral vessels are less sensitive to the sympathetic response and thus maintain relatively normal caliber, blood flow, and oxygen delivery. 

if the underlying causes are not corrected, shock passes imperceptibly to the progressive phase, during which there is widespread tissue hypoxia. in the setting of persistent oxygen deficit, intracellular aerobic respiration is replaced by anaerobic glycolysis with excessive production of lactic acid. the resultant metabolic lactic acidosis lowers the tissue pH and blunts the vasomotor esponse, arterioles dilate and blood begins to pool in the microcirculation. peripheral pooling not only worsens the cardiac output but also puts EC?? at risk for developing anoxic injury with subsequent DIC. with widespread tissue hypoxia, vital organs are affected andbegin to fail. 

clniical consequences 

the clinical manifestations of shock depend on the precipitating insult. in hypovolemix and cardiogenic shock, the patient presents with hypotension, a weak, rapid pulse, tachypnea and cool, clammy and cyanotic skin. in septic shock the skin may initially be warm and flushed because of peripheral vasodilation. the initial threat to life stems from the underlying catastrophe that precipitated the shock (myocardial infarct, severe hem, sepsis). 
rapidly however, the cardiac, cerebral and pulmonary changes secondary to shock worsen the problem. eventually electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis also exacerbate the situation. individuals who survive the initial complications may enter a second phase dominated by renal insufficiency and marked by a progressive fall in urine output as well as severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances. 

the prognosis varies with the origin of shock and its duration. this, greater than 90% of you, otherwise heathy patients with hypovolemic shock survive with appropritate management, in comparison, septic shock, or cardiogenic shock associated with extensive myocardial infarction, can have substantially worse mortality rates, even with optimal care.
