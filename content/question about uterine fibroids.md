a 35 year old woman, gravida 3 para 0 aborta 3, comes to the office due to recurrent pregnancy loss. the patient has had 3 first trimester spontaneous abortions in the last year and is becoming increasingly worried that she will bever carry a pregnancy to full term. she has regular, monthly menses with 4-5 days of moderate bleeding and cramping. the patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes a daily prenata vitamin. family history is noncontributory. she is married to a male partner who has no children from previous relationships. the patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. vital signs are normal. BMI is 24 kg/m2. on pelvic examination, the uterus is mall, anteverted, and nontender. there are no adnexal masses. urine pregnancy test is negative. results of maternal laboratory studies are as follows: 

TSH 0.9 microunits per liter 
lupus anticoagulant negative 
antiphospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody negative 
karyotype 46XX 

transvaginal ultrasound reveals a 2-cm submucosal fibroid at the uterine fundus. which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patinet's recurrent pregnancy loss? 

1. clomiphene ovulation induction 
2. hysteroscopic myomectomy 
3. low-molecular weight heparin 
4. semen analysis of the male partner 
5. uterine artery embolization 
6. vaginal progesterone

this patient has had more than three consecutive pregnancy losses (ie spontaneous abortions) consistent with recurrent pregnancy loss. intial work-up for these patients includes pelvic ultrasound, karyotype, and testing for antiphospholipid syndrome because anatomic, genetic, and thrombotic disorders are the most common causes. 

this patient's recurrent pregnancy loss is likely due to her submucosal fibroid, a benign smooth muscle (myometrial) tumor that can cause abnormal intrauterine anatomy by extending into the cavity or impingin on (ie disrupting) the endometrium. this comprises embryo implantation or growth, likely due to decreased endnometrial thickness and the reduced vascularity of the fibroid (relative to the myometrium) 

therefore, the most appropriate treatmenet for recurrent pregnancy loss due to submucosal fibroids is hysteroscopic myomectomy (even if the fibroids do not cause heavy menses). this procedure restores normal intrauterine anatomy, thereby reducing the risk for future pregnancy loss. 

! 

clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to treat ovulatory infertility by increasing FSH levels and promoting ovarian follicular development. it is not used to treat recurrent pregnancy loss and has antiestrogen effects that decrease endometrial thickness 

LMWH is used in women with recurrent pregnancy loss due to antiphospholipid syndrome, it does not improve live birth rates in women with a negative work-up 

uterine artery embolization decreases blood flow to the uterus, thereby reducing fibroid size. it is not recommended for patient desiring future fertility because the resultant decreased uterine perfusion increases the risk for obstetric complications (fetal growth restriction) and decreases live birth rates 

vaginal progesterone is offered to patients with an incidental shortened cervic (<25mm) on ultrasound or a prior history of cervical insufficiency because it may decrease the risk for preterm deliver. it does not reduce the risk for recurrent pregnancy loss.
