72 year old woman is brought to the office by her daughter for evaluation of leg swelling and fatigue 

the patient recently moved in with her daughter and has not seen a physician in severeal years. she ahs ahad bilateral lower extremity swelling for the past 3 months. the patient has had fatigue and joint pains for the past several years, which she attributes to old age. The daughter states that the patient seem tired all the time, barely eats anything, and "is just not herself". The patient takes no medication and does not use tobacco, alcohol or reacreational drugs. BP is 116/72, HR 78 and regular. the lungs are clear on ausculation and heart sounds are normal. the abdomen is soft and nontender. examination of the lower extremities reveals 3+ pitting edema. there are scattered ecchymoses and hand examination findings show characteristic hand deformities (ulnar deviation, swan neck deformity, nodules). Labs:

Hb 10.8
MCV 90 
Plates 350 
WOBC 8.8

SCr 0.9 
Ca 9.1 
Glucose 94

Albumin 2.8 

urine 4+ protein 
no cells/ no casts 

What will a renal biopsy of this patient most likely show? 

1. congo-red positive glomerular deposits (c)
2. glomerular immune deposits and cellular proliferation 
3. hyalinization in th earteriorles and small arteries 
4. marked mononuclear interstitial infiltration 
5. urate crystal deposition in the interstitium 

This is a presentation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated by AA amyloidosis. Serum amyloid A protein is an acute phase reactant; therefore, AA amyloidosis often develops in the setting of chronic inflammation (like osteomyelisits, rheumatologic disease).

"Long-standing RA is the most common cause and patients with untreated RA are particularly susceptible." 

the most common manifestation of AA amyloidosis is renal disease with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome. skin involvement can lead to thickening or easy bruising (eg. ecchymoses); cardiac - cardiomyopathy, GI - hepatomegaly, dysmotility and neuro (peripheral neuropathy, dementia, stroke). 

lab shows increased ESR (inflammatory marker) and normocytic anemia due to chronic inflammmtion. 

renal biopsy demonstrates amorphous hyaline material that stains with Congo red. green birefringence is noted under polarized light 

rationale for wrong answers 

1) glomerular immune depostis and cellular proliferation: "proliferative GN demonstrates cellular proliferation andglomerular immune deposits on hisotlogy but usually presents with hypertension, hematuria and rbc casts. in typical, it is mostly associated with SLE and not RA."
2) hyalinization in the arterioles and small arteries: "hypertensive nephrosclerosis is characterized by hyalinization of the arterioles and small arteries and results in CKD-howerever, it is caused by long-standing, uncontrolled hypertension. in additino, although proteinuri can occur with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, nephrotic-range proteinuria is unexpected (fatty casts on urine microscopy can be seen with nephrotic syndrome, but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis)"\
3) Marked mononuclear interstitial infiltration: "acute interstitial nephritis causes renal injury and is classically associated with certain drugs. it can occur with systemic disease (SLE) but it is less commonly associated with RA. It is typically characterized by fevers, rash, and urinary white blood cells and white blood cell casts"
4) Urate crystal deposition in the interstittium: "hyperuricemia cna result in urate deposition within th erenal interstitium and can lead to renal injury, and gout can cause joint pain and deformity. however, urate crystals are expected on urinalysis and gout flares typically cause a monoarticular arthritis characterised by a warm, swollen, exquisitely painful joint. this patient's unlar deviation, swan neck deformity and nodules are more consistent with RA"
