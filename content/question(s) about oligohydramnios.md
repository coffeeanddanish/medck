29 yo primigravid woman 30 weeks gestation comes to the office for evaluation of decreased fetal movement 

the patient has had minimal fetalmovement for the past few hours. she has had no vaginal bleeding or contractions. the patient has sickle cell disease and is taking low-does aspirin. her pregnancy is dated by a 10-week ultrasound, and she had a normal fetal anatomy ultrasound at 18 weeks gestation. at 24 weeks gestation, the patient had an abnormal glucose challenge test, but a normal glucose tolerance test. blood pressure 134/82 and pulse is 90 BMI is 32. fetal heart rate is 140, fundal height is 26cm, ultrasound reveals a cephalic male fetus measuring at the 16th percentile and an amniotic fluid index of 4cm. which of the ofllowing is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

1. fetal congenital infection 
2. inaccurate pregnancy dating 
3. maternal obesity 
4. pregnancy-induced hyperglycemia 
5. uteroplacental insufficiency (c)

"patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for multiple obstetric complications (preeclamsia, fetal growth restriction .. ) due to vasoocclusion that can result in placental infarction, ischemia, and subsequent uteroplacental insufficiency

adequate uteroplacental blood flow is essential for normal fetal development. utereplacental insufficiency results in decreaesd fetal perfusion, which limits fetal oxygenation and nutrition. in response, the fetus has decreased fetal movement, slowed growth (with possible fetal growth restriction), and preferential shunting of blood flow from th ekidneys to the brain, as evidenced by decreased urine production and resultant oligohydramnios. oligohydramnios can present with a uterine size less-than-date's dicrepancy (fundal ht at 26 at 30 weeks gestation)

due to the high risk of intrauterine fetal demise associated with uteroplacental insufficiency, management is with close antenatal surveillance (serial growth ultrasound, umbilical artery Doppler ultrasound) for monitoring of fetal well-being and delivery planning"

QID 17174

33 yo woman, g3 p0 a2 at 28 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit 

the patient has had no contractions, vaginal bleeding or leakage fo fluid. fetal movement is normal. he pregnancy is complicated by type 1 diabetes that has become increasingly difficult to control with her insulin regimen. during the past months, most of the patient's postprandial blood glucose levels have been more than 200 mg/dL. an anatomy ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation was normal, a f/u growth ultrasound at 24 weeks gestation was at the 30th percentile. blood pressure is 124/82, pulse 88. fundal height is 24. nonstress test is reactive and reassuring. ultrasound reveals a cephalic fetus measuring at the 4th percentile for gestational age and AFI 3 cm. which of the following is the best next step in management 

1. cervical nucleic acid amplification testing
2. fetal aneuploidy testing 
3. fetal fibronectin testing 
4. repeat ultrasound in 2 weeks 
5. umbilical artery dopple ultrasound (c)

"this patient has fetal growth restriction, as estimated fetal weight at <10th percentile for gestational age. FGR can be a complication of maternal vascular disease......."
