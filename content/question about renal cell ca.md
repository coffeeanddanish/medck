what are the signs and symptoms of renal cell carcinoma? 

so you have your flank pain, hematuria and palpable abdominal mass 

but the question tries to focus on the clue of left-sided varicocele, being one of the significant signs of RCC 

then we can look at paraneoplastic conditions such as: 
anemia or erythrocytosis 
thrombocytosis 
fever 
hypercalcemia 
cachexia 

Most RCC patients are asymptomatic until the disease is advanced. the classic triad of RCC is flank pain hematuira and palpable abdominal mass - this is found in 10% of patients. when present, it strongly suggests advanced or metastatic disease. 

hematuria is seen in approx 40% of patients and signifies tumor invasion of the collecting system. scrotal varicoceles (most are left-sided) are observed in about 10% of patients. varicoceles typically fail to empty when the patient is recumbest die to tumor obsetruction of the gonadal vein where it enters the renal vein. presence of this finding should always raise suspicious for mass obstruction to venous flow, as is seen in renal cell ca. 

20% of patient may also have constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, or easy fatiguability. ectopic production of erythropoetin by the tumor can produce polycythemia, although most advanced tumors are associated with anemia. ct scan of the abdomen is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing RCC and should be obtained whn the index of suspicious is high
