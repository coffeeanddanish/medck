what is pneumonia? 

pneumonia is inflammation of pulmonary tissue with consolidation of alveolar air spaces 

incidence is greatest in the first year of life, with the majority of infections  below the age of five being owed to viral causes

community acquired pneumonia 

for neonates ie under 1 month, we have bacterial infections: strep pneumo, listeria and e coli. viruses are: CMV, HSV and enterovirus. give ampicillin or gentamycin. for infants 1-3 months: the causative organisms are strep pneumoniae, staph aureus and chlamydia tranchomatis. the viral list is a bit longer and includes: rsv, influenza viru, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus. these infections are now treated with ampicillin or ceftriaxone, except for the case of c. trachomatis where azithromycin is used. from 3mo - 5 years, the viral list remains the same and the bacterial list substitutes chlamydia for strep pyogenes. now ampicillin, azithromycin or ceftriaxone may be used. for cases above 5 years, we have three kinds of pneumoniae bacteria: strep, mycoplasma and chlamydia. myco and chlamydia are contenders for clarithromycin and azithromycin. rest take amoxicillin, ampicillin, or ceftriaxone. the one and only virus in this list is: influenza 

supportive therapy is usually humidified oxygen, antipyretics and hydration
