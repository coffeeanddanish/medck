the tentorium cerebelli is a transverse fold of the dura that separates the forebrain from the hindbrain. it projects forward between the cerebellum and the occipital lobe in the transverse plane, it would appear as a thin sliver of membrane or lining between the upper, occipital lobe, and the lower, cerebellum, starting from the internal occipital protruberence. it is shaped like a tent - hence the name - where the superior pole merges with the posterior part of the falx cerebri. 

the tentorium cerebelli mushrooms into a fan-like fashion as it travels from the falx cerebri inferiorly to its complete horizontal base. 

it has two margins or borders, the anterior margin, which is free and concave in the transverse plane. It forms a ring or 'notch' for the passage of structures between the fore and hindbrain. 

posterior margin 

the posterior margin, which follows the same concavity, has attachments, and can be assumed as the 'outer' border of the tentorium cerebelli. posteriorly, it is attached to the internal occipital protruberance, as it projects rostrally, filling and fanning out in (transverse orientation) into the circular border of the internal cranial cavity, it attaches laterally to the transverse sulcus (occupied by the transverse sinus) and to the superior border of the [[petrous]] part of the temporal bone (which is a bony projection of the temporal bone, diagonal and 2/3rds from the midline in the posterior cranial fossa, almost converging to the midline in the middle cranial fossa). From there, the tentorium cerebelli reaches and attaches to posterior clinoid process (of the [[sphenoid]] bone). 

however, the free margin has an anterior attachment into the anterior clionoid process of the basal wing of sphenoid. both the attachments cross over each other. 

Just lateral to this crossing of the two attachments of the tentorium cerebelli margins, is the cavum trigeminale or 'meckel's cave' which houses the [[trigeminal]] ganglion. 

Anterior to the crossing is the occulumotor trigone, which contains the [[occulomotor]] nerve. 

content of the tentorium cerebelli 

as I said before, the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli forms a partial ring around the structures connecting the hind and forebrain. this structure is the [[midbrain]] and the superior vermis of the [[cerebellum]]

the point where the tentorium cerebelli and the falx cerebri meet is the location of the straight sinus.
