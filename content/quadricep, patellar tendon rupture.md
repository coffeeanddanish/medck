the question may show a lateral knee x-ray with a displaced patella. patella displaced above is known as patella alta and the tendon intact is from the quadriceps, therefore the dislocation is upwards. the patella being displaced below is known as patella baja, and the tendon that has ruptured is the quadriceps tendon

on injury, the patient will not be able to stand on the joint (weight bearing), will not be able to extend (increase the angle of the joint) and injury qualifiers (i made up that word) are pain, swelling, inflammation. for joints, do not forget pocket of effusion 

now the indication for surgery depends on the functioning. if not able to use the joint, go for surgery. earlier the better, a delay can be defined as approx. 6 weeks

when you investigate, ask the patient to raise the leg when straightened. a straight leg is IMPOSSIBLE with complete rupture. an incomplete rupture = tears in tendon

clinical features will show a displaced patella, and an audible pop will be heard 

how is the injury sustained 

sudden forceful contraction of quadriceps during an attempt to decelerate
"eccentric loading of extensor mechanism, esp. when foot is planted and knee slightly bent"

risk factors are DM, SLE, RA, or any degenerative changes 

repair complications? 
quadriceps contracture 
adhesions 
patellar migration

OR37
