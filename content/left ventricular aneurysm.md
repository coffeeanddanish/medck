ventricular aneurysm is a late complication of myocardial infarction that can occur up to several months following a trnasmural (ST elevation) MI. a delaye in coronary perfusion increases the risk. the healing process following MI results in replacement of necrosed myocardium with fibrous scar tissue, which in the case of a large MI can result in convexity of a large portion of the left ventricular wall (most commonly in the perfusion field of the LAD). the aneurysm is dyskinetic with the remaining healthy ventricular wall, resulting in impaired ejection fraction. 

although heart failure (sx like JVD or pulmonary crackles) is the most common presentation, angina may also occur due to increased oxygen demand caused by elevated wall stress in the setting of an enlarged left ventricle. ventricular arrhythmia or systemic embolization (due to mural thrombus inside the aneurysm) is possible as well. classical ECG findings include ___persistent ST elevation and deep Q waves___ in leads corresponsing to the previous MI and diag. is confirmed by echocardiogram showing a thinned and dyskinetic myocardial wall.
