20 yo man is found to have elevated calcium level on pre-employment screening blood tests 

he feels well and has no pyuria, polydypsia, constipation. his medical history is unremarkable. he takes no prescription medications, although he has been cocnsuming 'protein shakes and vitamin supplements' in prepartion for running a marathon. the patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs. temp is 37, 110/70 and HR82. o/e is unremarkable. labs: 

Na 140 
K 4.0 
Chloride 103 
bicarb 24
bun 18 
SCr 0.8 
ca 11.2
glucose 98
albumin 4.2 
PTH 65 (10-65) pico per mL 
urine calcium:creat clearance ratio is <0.01 

which of the following is most consistent with this patient's findings 

1. familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (c)
2. multiple myeloma 
3. primary hyperparathyroidism 
4. rcc 
5. sarcoidosis 
6. vit d toxitcity 

"thispatient has mild aymptomatic hypercalcemia and normal renal function. in light of a high PTH level and low urinary calcium excretion, this presentation is consistent with the condition of familial hypocalciuric hyrercalcemia (FHH). FHH is a benign autosomal dominant disorder caused by a *mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)*. normally, high-normal calcium levels suppress PTH secretion by the psrathyroid glands, but in FHH, higher calcium concentrations are required to suppress PTH release. Concurrectly, the defective CaSR leads to increased reabsorption of calcium in renal tubules. 

in the evaluation of hypercalcemia, an elevated or inapproporiately normal PTH levels suggests either primary hyperparathyroidism or FHH. However, patients with promary hyperparathyroidism have increased urinary calcium excretion due to excessive mobilization of calcium from bones, whereas patients with FHH usually have very low urinary calcium levels (typically <100mg/24hr). Urine calcium excretion, can be more precisely assessed by urine calcium/creatinine clearance ratio

UCCR is usually less than 0.01 in FHH, whereas it is >0.02 in primary hyperparathyroidism 

most patients with FHH are asymptomatic, although potential complications include pancreatitis and chondrocalcinosis. in the absence of complications, no specific treatment is required"
