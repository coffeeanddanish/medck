peripheral artery disease is a chronic ischemic condition that causes pain due to inadequate vascular supply. it most commonly occurs in the lower limbs and can affect when walking or during rest. PAD is predominantly associated with atherosclerosis, thereby making it a condition with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors to improve the outcome of the condition. modifiable risk factors are ordinarily diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking etc; whereas salient points of non-modifiable risk factors are a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or cerebrovascular disease, in addition, advanced age also stands as a non-modifiable risk factor. peripheral artery disease has two varieties: one where the pain occurs during exercise (mostly walking) and is known as claudication, and one where the pain occurs at rest (usually presenting as waking the patient up from sleep) and is known as chronic limb-threatening ischemia or CLTI short. 

peripheral artery disease clinical features of claudication involve pain with exertion, usually the calves, or the group of muscle being exercised. the pain is always in the same location, requires the same time, exertion, or distance walked to elicit the pain, and similarly, requires the same amount of time for the pain to be relieved. postural changes are unecessary in this variety when compared to CLTI. In short, the pain in claudication is reproducible with the same characteristics. the relief we see is about five minutes, but personally, that seems to be a subjective data. the presence of preceding clinical features help differentiate vascular claudication from neurologic claudication or MSK pain. 

chronic limb-threatening ischemia is seen at rest, usually presents at night, waking the patient up. The pain is in the forefoot or on the toes, and the patient has to 'hang his feet from the edge of the bed' for relief. along with this, we can also find ulceration or gangrene (tissue loss). to qualify, the patient must have a pre-existing PAD for atleast two weeks, but I do not know why this piece of information is helpful. 
ankle presure is 50 mm Hg, toe pressure is less than 30 mm Hg, and the ABI is less than 0.40 
signs of poor perfusion are hair loss, hypertrophic nails, shiny skin, atrophic muscle, ulceration or infection, slow capillary refill, prolonged pallor upon elevation and rubor on dependency, venous troughing (buerger's sign or angle) which is collapse of superficial veins of the foot. 

CLTI poses a high-risk of limb amputation in 1 year within 25% and mortality also within 25%. It is usually a result of multilevel arterial occlusions in the lower extremity

Investigations 
routine bloodwork and fasting metabolic panel 
ABI - highest ankle pressure (either dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) divided by brachial pressure 
[[Ranges for ABI ]]
Remeber: toe brachial index or TBI is taken in non-compressible vessels
Arterial DUS (duplex ultrasound) is a combination of b-mode and doppler ultrasound to visualize blood vessels and characterize flow and plaques 
Non-invasive measures would be CT angio and MR angio for visualizing large arteries (aorta, iliac, femoral and popliteal) but may have difficulty with tibial
Warning for nephropathy: IV iodinated contrast for CTA, much worse effect for MRA which uses gadolinium
Invasive: an arteriography. best way to visualize, intraop intervention 

Treatment 

pharmacotherapy: 
antiplatelets - ASA, clopidogrel 
anticoagulants - low-dose rivaroxaban 
statin 
ACEi or ARB 

surgical 
indications will be severe lifestyle impairment, vocational impairment and/or CLTI 
revascularization
-endovascular (angioplasty w/w/o stenting)
-endarctectomy which is removal of plaque and repair with a patch (usually distal aorta or common deep femoral - i dont know what this means, are they saying that is the site to harvest or the site of patch?)
-bypass graft sites: anatomic will be: aortofemoral, femoropoplitial and popliteal-tibial bypass
extra-anatomy will be axillofemoral, femorofemoral, femorotibial bypass
-graft choices: saphenous vein graft (reversed or in situ), synthetic (polytetrafluoroethylene like Gore-Tex or Dacron), cryo-preserved homograft

amputation?
anatomically irrepairable
persistant serious infection/gangrene 
unremitting rest pain

UWorld QID 4241 

a 73 year old man comes to the physician becaus of right anterior thigh pain that is worse with walking. 

he has a history of stable angina, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and COPD, with periodic exacerbations. he takes ipratropium, aspirin, metaprolol, pravastatin. he smokes 2 packs a day and drinks alcohol occasionally. physical examination shows a small pulsatile mass in the right groin area. which of the following is the most likely diag.? 

1. femoral vein aneurysm 
2. femoral artery aneurysm (c)
3. indirect inguinal hernia 
4. direct induinal hernia 
5. femoral hernia
