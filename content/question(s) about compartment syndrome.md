a 56 yo man is evaluated for increased right arm swelling 

he was admitted 12 hours earlier after being found unresponsive at the bottom of his apartment stairs. trauama work up revealed a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and small subdural hematoma. swelling of the right forearm was also noted, but XRAY showed no fracture, compartmet pressures were within normal range 

lab testing revealed a blood ethanol level of 380 and leuk of 15,000. the patient was subsequently admitted to the neurointensive unit 

during th emost recent examination, the nurse increased right forearm swelling. vital signs are normal. he is intubated and sedated. the right forearm is tense and swollen with mild erythema but no fluctuance, crepitus, or streaking. the patient grimaces when the right arm is manipulated. pulses are normal. which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's arm swelling? 

1. administer IV antibiotics 
2. apply a compressive wrap and elevate the limb 
3. obtain CT angio of the upper extremity 
4. obtain MRI of the upper exptremity
5. request immediate surgical consultation (c)

"this patient ahs most likely developed compartment syndrome, a condition in which increased pressure within an enclosed fascial space limits perfusion of tissues 

the right forearm likley sustained ischemia injury from prolonged compression because the patient had lain unresponsive (for an unknown duration of time) at the bottom of the stairs. on initial examination, mild swelling was noted, although compartment pressures were measured as normal. However, over the next 12 hours, reperfusion (due to relief from compression) and likely fluid resuscitation led to increased edema, evidenced by tense swelling and pain (grimacing) on passive manipulation on reexamination"

QID 15654

65 yo man is brought tot hte emergency after a motor vehicle collision 

the patient was the restrained front passenger in a car that skidded on ice and hit a tree at 25mph. his right leg awas pinned under the dashboard, and extrication took 2 hours. 

th epatient has severe right leg pain which is minimally relieved with morphine.

he has a hisotyr of MI 6 months ago for which he takes aspirin and clopidogrel. blood pressure is 102/72, pulse is 111. on physicaly examination, the patient is mildly sedated. the right leg appears swollen and bruised. sensation is intact. passive movement of the right ankle and toes cause severe pain in the lower leg. bilaeral pedal pulses are palpable. xrya of the right lower extremity is negative for a fracture. which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's leg pain? 

1. apply a compression wrap 
2. measure leg compartment pressures (c)
3. obtain a lower extremity arteriogram 
4. order a CT scan of the lower extremiy
5. perform a lower extremity venous ultrasound 
6. place the leg in balanced traction 

---
**Acute compartment syndrome of the extremity**

pathophysiology 
increased presssure within the enclosed fascial space - and - decreased blood flow and tissue perfusion 

common causes 
crush injury 
long bone fracture 
rhabdomyolysis 

reperfusion after prolonged ischemia 
massive fluid resusciation 

clinical features - early - progressive and severe pain, rapidly increasing and tense swelling, increased pain with passive stretching, paresthesia 

late features - decreased sensatino, weakness (within hours), paralysis (late), uncommon - loss of pulse 

Management 

compartment pressure measurement can confirm the diagnosis and ___emergency fasciotomy___
