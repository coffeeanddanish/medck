defined as tachypnea of >60 resps per minute and tachycardia of >160 bpm
clinical features: what will the baby do? grunting noises, subcostal or intercostal indrawing, nasal flaring 
duskiness and central [[cyanosis]], what does duskiness mean = acrocyanotic
crackles on ausculation, decreased air entry 

a depressed newborn has ineffective respiratory effort and cyanosis. approximately 10% of newborn babies require mechanical ventilation 

what are the differentials? 

Under respiratory problems:
[[respiratory distress syndrome]] aka hyaline membrane disease 
pulmonary hypoplasia 
CNS depression 
[[meconium aspiration syndrome]] 
[[transient tachypnea of newborn]]
pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusion

causes of anemia (severe)
erythroblastosis fetalis 
secondary hydrops fetalis 

maternal causes would be: 
drugs and anesthesia; so...
opiates and magnesium sulfate
then: diabetes 

congenital malformations/ birth injury
nuchal cord
[[bilateral phrenic nerve injury]]
[[potter's sequence]] 

shock 
antepartum hemorrhage 

congenital heart ds 
transposition of great vessels w/ intact ventricular septum 

Other
Hypothermia 
Hypoglycaemia 
Infection

[[pediatric respiratory distress]]


could we make a question differentiating the three main respiratory distress syndromes: MAS, TTN, RDS??
