(choice 1) cenrvical cancer screening most commonly begins at age 21 with cervical cytology (ie pap test). however, routine hymn papillomavirus (HPV) cotesting is not recommeded in patient age<30 because most HPV infections are transient and spontaneously clear in younger patients. unnecessary cotesting increases the risk of cervical procedures, which can lead to obstetric complications (like preterm birth). instead, this patient should be offered the HPV vaccination series which can be initiated at age <26 regardless of sexual activity 

(choice 3) clean-catch urinalysis is used to evaluate for cystitis in patinets with symptoms (like dysuria and hematuria). this patient is asymptomatic, and screening for cystitis in asymptomatic patients is generally not recommended 

(choice 5) routune syphilis screening (nontreponemal serology) is recommended in asymptomatic patients with prior sexually transmitted infection, >1 sexual partner in th elast 6 months, high-risk populations (example: men who have sex with men), and pregnant patients due to the risk of congenital syphilis. this patient does not meet the criteria for testing (that is: no symptoms of syphilis, which are, chancre, or maculopapular rash) or routine screening 

(choice 6) wet mount microscopy evaluated for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, and trichomoniasis, all of which typically present with vaginal discharge. in contrast, this asymptomatic patient would likely have normal vaginal flora on microscopy, making this test unnecessary.
