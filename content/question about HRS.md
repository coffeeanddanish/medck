58 yo man hospitalzied for confusion is evaluated for elevate serum creatinine. 

he has a history of cirrhosis due to chronic hep c infection and evaluation at the time of admission revealed hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. since admission, the patient's mental status was gradually improved with lactulose and cefotaxime therapy, but his renal functioning has worsened. at home, he takes furosemide, spironolactone, and nadolol, all of which were stopped at the time of admission. temp 37, blood pressure 98/62, 102HR. physical examination shows jaundice, spider angiomas, ascites, and leg edema. he has no skin rash. serum creat and urine output since admission are shown below: 

Day of admission - day 1 - day 2 - day 3 - day 4
SCr 1.1 - 1.6 - 2.4 - 3.1 - 3.9
UO - - 2100 - 1400 - 800 - 500

urinalysis reveals 1-2 erythrocytes/hpf with no significant casts or protein. Renal ultrasound shows normal-size kidneys with no hydronephrosis. there has been no improvement in renal function with intravenous saline and albumin infusion. which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's renal dysfunction? 

1. drug-mediated renal tubular injury 
2. glomerular immune complex deposition 
3. intravascular volume depletion 
4. renal interstitial inflammation 
5. splanchnic arterial dilation (c)

This question is about hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): 

HRS is characterized by a significant decrease in glomerular filtration in the absence of another clear cause of renal dysfunction, minimal hematuria (<50rbc/hpf) and lack of improvement with volume resuscitation. 

HRS occus as cirrhosis progresses and patients develop ***splanchnic arterial dilation*** and an overall decrease in _vascular resistance_. this, in turn, activates the raas and results in local renal vasoconstriction with decreased perfusion and glomerular filtration. the most common inciting factors of hrs include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

treatment: either transplant or discontinuing harmful factors. 

medical alternative: splanchnic vasoconstriction: midodrine, octreotide, norepinephrine and albumin

dialysis is of limited benefit but may be attempted to help bridge to liver transplantation

----
hepatorenal syndrome 

risk factors 
advanced cirrhosis with portal hypertension 
acute liver failure, severe alcoholic hepatitis 

pathophysiology 
splanchnic vasodilation -> renal hypoperfusion -> RAAS activation -> overwhelming renal vasocontstriction -> acute kidney injury 
precipitants: gastrointestinal bleed, infection (SBP)

diag. 
bland urinalysis 
very low urine sodium (<10)
exclusion of other causes of aki 
no improvement with trial of volume expansion 

treatment 
albumin + splanchnic vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, norepinephrine, midodrine + octreotide)
liver transplant
