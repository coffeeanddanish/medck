intestinal ischemia is a topic in general surgery that beckons knowledge about its treatment and investigations, and eventually, indications for surgery 

the etiology can be divided into arterial occlusive vs non-occlusive, and venous thrombosis

(1) the arterio-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (AOMI) can be due to a thrombus, emboli or an external compression such as a strangulating [[hernia]] ; (2) non-occlusive variety (NOMI) can be secondary to vasoconstriction. the body preserves vital organs in a state of hypoperfusion ; (3) mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT), most likely a hypercoagulable state (make sure to rule out malignancy) and [[DVT]] (which would prevent venous outflow)

now that we are familiar with the etiology, let's look at the clinical presentation. the most notable thing is the pain which is out of proportion (or more than) what the physical findings are. pls remember that any case of acute abdomen with [[metabolic acidosis]] is considered bowel ischemia unless proven otherwise

then the question arises, how would one _prove_ that it is bowel ischemia 

lab findings will show non-specific leukocytosis (at first) with [[lactic acidosis]] as a late finding
amylase, lactate, CK and ALP can be used to monitor progress

before we move on, the distribution of intestinal ischemia is important, which is, SMA distribution, splenic flexure, left and sigmoid colon 

abdominal x-rays will show portal venous gas, intestinal pneumatosis and free-air if perforation. further up in imaging, we can do a contrast CT which will show a thickened bowel wall, luminal dilatation, SMA or SMV thrombus, mesenteric or portal venous gas and pneumatosis. a CT angiography is the gold standard for acute arterial ischemia. 

how is it treated? Phase 1 is supportive therapy, therefore, fluid resuscitation and NPO with an NG tube to decompress the stomach and prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics. there are two drugs to be avoided: vasoconstrictors and digitalis

phase 2 is exploratory laparotomy/laparoscopy to assess extent of viability w/w/o segmental resection of necrotic intestine. if extent of bowel viability is uncertain, a second-look laparotomy 12-24 h later is necessary 

phase 3 is (?) angiogram, embolectomy/thrombectomy, bypass/graft, mesenteric endarterectomy, anticoagulation therapy, and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty w/w/o stent
