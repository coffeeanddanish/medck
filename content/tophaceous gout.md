"Tophi (i.e., large aggregates of monosodium urate crystals) may also form in the nearby humeroulnar joint or other types of soft tissues (eg, ligaments, tendons). Tophi often trigger a chronic inflammatory response in the surrounding tissue and bone, resulting in bone erosions with overhanging edges of cortical bone on imaging. urate is intrinsically radiolucent by can become radioopaque when calcium precipitates with urate in a tophus. risk factors for tophus formation include chronically untreated gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD)9due to decreased uric acid excretion)"
