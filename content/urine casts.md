57 yo woman is admitted to the ICU after being involved in a highway motor vehicle accident 

she was hypotensive at the scene and recieved 7L of fluids, which include crystalloids, blood and fresh frozen plasma. she had significant external blood loss from multiple fractures and skin loss. she undergoes surgery, after which she is transferred to the ICU and receives continuous IV fluids and vasopressors. he lab studies 24 hours after the accident show

hb 9.5 
wbc 15
plates 130 
BUN 33 
SCr 2.2 

which of the following is the most likely microscopic finding on urinalysis? 

1. broad cast 
2. muddy brown cast 
3. red blood cell cast 
4. white blood cell casts 
5. fatty casts 
6. eosinophis 

th eclinical picture of this patiet is highly suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following hypovolemix shock. A serum BUN:SCr ratio of 10-15 is typically seen in ATN (in contrast to prerenal azotemia, where the ratio is more than 20). Other findings that support this diagnosis are: 

1. urine osmolality of 300-500 
2. urine sodium of more than 20 
3. FENa of >2% 
prolonged hypotension from any cause can lead to ATN. the hallmark findings on urinalysis are muddy brown granular casts consisting of renal tubular epithelial cells; this is a nonspecific by very sensitive finding for ATN 

Muddy brown granular cast - ATN 
RBC - glomerulonephritis 
WBC - interstitial nephritis pyelonephritis 
fatty casts - nephrotic syndrome 
broad and waxy casts - chronic renal failure
