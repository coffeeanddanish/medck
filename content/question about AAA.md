a 62 yo man comes to the emergency department due to sudden onset, severe abdominal pain 2 hours ago. 

- th epatient tates that he suddenly felt weak, diaphoretic and without energy 
- he has a 30 pack year smoking history and drinks alcohol on occasion. 
- temp is 36.8 blood pressure on arrival is 88/64, pulse is 117 and regular, and resps are 18
- physical examination shows a _diffusely tender bowel with flank ecchymoses_. there is no rigidity or gaurding. bowel sounds are present. 
- during th e examination, the patient becomes pale and drowsy. IV fluid boluses are started- next step? 

Echo FAST 

so lets talk about it

Evaluation of suspected unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm 

so first of all, what are the symptoms that suggest an unstable AAA? 

1. abdominal / flank / groin pain 
2. pulsatile mass 
3. flank ecchymosis 
4. limb ischemia 

what does hemodynamically stable mean? chapter on [[shock]]!! 

this patient has 'sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain' --> why reading the first line CAREFULLY is important. What is the significance of sudden and not-sudden?? I don't know

//start again 

this patient with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability and flank ecchymosis likely has a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. patients aged >60, smokers and men, +with hx of atherosclerosis or connective tissue diseases are at increased risk for AAA. 

these patients often have few symptoms until the AAA markedly expands or ruptures, leading to abdominal or flank pain that may be accompanied by a pulsatile abdominal mass. rupture can occur into the retroperitoneum or freely into the peritoneal cavity, the latter often leading to the rapid development of hemodynamic instability shock. 

evaluation algorithm: 

symptoms? do they suggest AAA? 
abdominal, flank or groin pain, 
pulsatile mass 
flank ecchymosis 
limb ischemia????????????? 

is the patient hemodynamically stable y/n? 
no
is it a known AAA? 
if yes, 
emergency repair 

if no, obtain focused abdominal ultrasound 
then when AAA is id'd go for emergency repair, 

hemodynamically stable 
yes? -> do a CT abdomen and then go ahead from there
