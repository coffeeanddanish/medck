21 yo woman comes to the office with her mother due to progressive weakness and fatigue. 

she nearly collapsed yesterday during one of her routine 3-hours workouts. her mother adds that the patient is not doing well academically despite persistent attempts to improve her grades. blood pressure is 106/58, pulse is 110, BMI 21. physical examination shows dry skin, fine facial hair, dental enamel erosions. the lungs are clear to ausculation and heart sounds are normal. the abdomen is doft and nontender. there is no lower extremity edema. lab: 

sodium 134 
potassium 2.4 
chloride 90 
bicarbonate 40 
urine chloride 9 

in addition to potassium supplementation, which of the following is the best treatment for correcting the lab abnormalities in this patient 

1. acetazolamine 
2. ammonium chloride 
3. breating into a paper bag 
4. fludrocortisone 
5. normal saline (c)
6. spironolactone 

this is a case of hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis 

common etiologies 
-gastric suction or severe vomiting 
-loop r thiazide diuretic overuse 

pathophysiology 
-gastric or renal H+ losses initiate alkalosis 
-volume depletion activates RAAS 
-increased renal potassium and hydrogen losses cause hypokalemia and worsen alkalosis 
-relatively greater loss of chloride than sodium causing profound chlorine depletion 
decreased chlorine impairs renal hco3 excretion to perpetuate alkalosis 

management 
-remove or treat initiating factor 
-cl- replenishment with normal saline corrects alkalosis 

this patient's fatigue, fine facial hair (lanugo), dental erosions, and excessive exercise (likely as a compensatory behavior) are suggestive of bulimia nervosa. bulimia nervosa os characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by purging, most often via self-induced vomiting. chronic vomiting leads to volume depletion (eg., near-syncope, sinus tachycardia) and metabolic alkalosis (eg., elevated HCO3-)

vomiting leads to loss of hydrogen and chloride (hydrochloric acid) from the gastrointestinal tract. this results ina. net gain in HCO3- that initiated metabolic alkalosis. the kidneys resong by attempting to elimitate this alkali load; however, they are unable to do so because the low chloride from vomiting impairs the hco3 excretion. therefore, cl- depletion perpetuates metabolic alkalosis; it can be confirmed by a low urine cl-

QID 2819

32 yo woman is brought tot hte emergency due to weakness, tingling and numbness in her extremities 

she takes no medications. blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 90 and resp are 14. physican exam is unremarkable, lab as follows: 

sodium 135
k 2.9 
cl- 88 
bicarb 37 
BUN 22 
creat 0.9 
pH 7.56 
urine e- 
cl1 7 (N=>20)
na 16(N=>40)

which of the following is the most liekly cause of this patients condition? 

1. hypoventilation syndrome 
2. persistent diarrhea 
3. primary hyperaldosteronism 
4. self-iduced vomiting 
5. type 1 rta 

this pt's ph>7.45 and serum HCO3- >24 is cosistent with primary metabolic alkalosis 

"meausrement of urine chloride can be helpsul in the differential diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis because adequeate cl- delivery to the distal renal tubules is necessary for excreiton of hco3-, which means that total body chloride depletion often plays an important role in the initiation and maintencene of metabolic alkalosis"

idk about this question sorry
