a 9 yea rold girl with a history of sickle cell anemia is admitted to the hospital for pain control during an acute pain crisis 

on hospital day 2, she has a right-sided weakness and right facial droop. CT scan confirms the presumptive diagnosis. what is the next step? 

1. alteplase
2. brain MRI 
3. exchange transfusion (c)
4. heparin drip 
5. tranexamic acid

acute stroke is a common manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD). In children and adolescents wtih SCD, ischemic stroke is more common than hemorrhagic stroke. neuroimaging is critical for all patients with suspected stroke. in children, a head CT is generally considered inadequate to diagnose ischemic stroke, and MRI may be needed to reliably exclude stroke mimics. 

for patients with SCD who have a confirmed acute ischemic stroke, transfusion therapy is recommended. the goals of transfusion are to lower the percentage of sickle hemoglobin (<30%) and to aim for a total Hb level of approximately 100g/L which is best achieved using exchange transfusion. 

alteplase: thrombolytic therapy is not approved for pediatric use 
Bran MRI may be needed to reliably exclude stroke mimis, however, in this particular patient, the diag. has already been confirmed, and additional imaging would delay the treatment 
Heparin, an anticoagulant, is not indicated in the treatment of ischemic stroke in pts. w SCD
tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent, is used in management of hemorrhae not ischemia 

comment: when saying stroke, it is important to remember that it is an ischemic stroke and not a hemorrhaic one.
