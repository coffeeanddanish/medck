a 6 hour old girl is evaluated in the newborn nursery due to respiratory distress 

she was born at 37 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery after induction of labor for preeclampsia with severe deatures. since birth, the baby has not been able to feed due to tachypnea. birth weight is at <3rd percentile for gestational age. temp is 37.2C and blood pressure is normal. pulse oximetry is 96% saturation on room air. examination reveals a plethoric infact. the head is normocephalic with an open and flat anterior fontanelle. cardiac examination reveals sinus tachycardia and no murmurs. pulmonary examination reveals tachypnea, breath sounds are clear throughout and there are no retractions. the infant has normal female infantile genitalia and cxr shows clear lung fields and a normal cardiac silhouette. Labs: 

hct 71% (42-65) 
plt 200,000 per cu. mm (150-300,000)
leukocytes 20,500 (9.4-24)
glucose 35mg/dL (>50)

which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms? 

1. congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
2. cyanotic heart disease 
3. dehydration 
4. glycogen storage disease 
5. polycythemia (c)
6. transient tachypnea of the newborn 

[[neonatal polycythemia]]

polycythemia is defined as hematocrit level of >65 (>2 standard deviations above the mean) in term neonates. causes include excessive transfusion (delayed umbilical cord clamping, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome), intrauterine hypoxia (poor placentation due to maternal diabetes or hypertension or smoking), or genetic conditions like trisomy 21. in this patient, maternal preeclampsia caused placental dysfunction, resulting in intrauterine hypoxia and growth restriction.

Other than a ruddy or plethoric appearance, most neonates with polycythemia are asymptomatic. as the hematocrit level rises due to postbirth fluid shifts, the increased blood viscosity may cause decreased blood flow to organs. common consequences include lethargy, irritability, and jitteriness. severe symptoms include respiratory distress, tachypnea, poor feeding, and cyanosis. the increased red blood cell mass can lead to hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia due to increased cellular uptake. treatment of polycythemia is hydration by oral feeds or glucose-containing parenteral fluids. 

wrong answers: 

classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia is caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency and can cause hypoglycemia and ambiguous genitalia in girls. other findings include dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and virilization. it does not cause polycythemia, and this infant has normal female genitalia. 

congenitale cyanotic heart disease can present with cyanosis in newborns, even without murmurs (transposition of great vessels). this infant's normal cardiac silhouette and normal auscultation, in the presence of high hematocrit, make polycythemia the most likely diagnosis 

dehydration can cause elevated hematocrit levels due to hemoconcentration. hoever, in the first two days of life, dehydration is rare in term neonates, as they are born with excess extracellular water. 

glycogen storage disease GSD type 1 or Von Gierke disease, is the most common GSD and presents with hypoglycemia in newborns. affected infants also have hepatomegaly and severe acidosis. polycythemia is not associated with GSD. 

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a common cause of respiratory distress in term neonates. CXR will show increased pulmonary vascular markings or fluid in the fissures. in contrast, infants with polycythemia have normal x-ras because the total fluid volume in the lungs is normal. 

CID 24574

A 37 year old primigravida delivers a boy at the 34th weeks of gestation. 1 minute after birth, the newborn is breathing irregularly, has cyanotic extremities and perioral anmd lip cyanosis. 

the newborn has a good muscle tone and strong response to stimulatinon. the child appears to have laboured breathing. the nasal flaring and the intercostal retractions are present. heart rate is 105 resp rate is 68. cxr shows ground glass appearance of the lungs. CPAP is applied and the child's condition is gradually improved. 

in which of the following is the most common long-term complication of the treatment of this pateint's condition? 

1. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (c)
2. pleural empyema 
3. intracerebral calcifications 
4. alveolar rupture 
5. there are no long-term complications 

the newborn has tachypnea, intercostal retracitons, nasal flaring and cyanosis; which is consistent with a respiratory failure. there is ground glass appearance of the lungs on xray. based on the clinical presentation and the fact that the baby is born premature, the most likely diagnosis is (neonatal) respiratory distress syndrome. 

- bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a form of chronic lung disease that develops in preterm neonates marked by lung disease and develops in preterm neonates treated with oxygen and positive pressure ventilaiton. it is marked by lung inflammation and scarring. more specifically, the high pressures of oxygen delievry result in necrotizing bronchiolitis and alveolar septal injury, further comprimising oxygenation of blood. 
* pleural empyema, also known as pyothorax or purulent pleuritis, is an accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity that can develop when bacteria invade the pleural space, usually is the complication of pneumonia 
* intracerebral calcifications are associated with congenital CMV 
* one of th eacute complications of respiratory distress syndrome is alveolar rupture
* [[transient tachypnea of newborn]] commnly resolves without any long-term complications
