a 25 yo woman is evaluated for occasional episodes of palpitations. 

she describes the episodes as a sudden, abrupt onset of fast and regular heartbeats that feel like "her heart is racing in her chest" The episodes are commonly unprovoked and are not related to exertion. During one episdoes, her blood pressure was recorded as 100/60 and her HR 185 and regular. she has no significant past medical history and does not take any medications. she has no family history of heart disease. physical examination is unremarkable, including no heart murmurs or additional sounds. she also reports that she has been self-treating by immersing her face in cold water during the palpitation episodes. generally, she says, cold-water immersion relieves her symptoms abruptly within several minutes. this maneuver terminates the palpitations by directly altering which of the following? 

1. atrioventricular node conductivity (c)
2. purkinje fiber conduction 
3. sinoatrial node automatism 
4. vascular tone 
5. venous return to the heart 
6. ventricular myocardium contractility 

this patients clinical presentation - abrupt onset of regular tachycardia that resolves with cold-water immersion - is consistent with PSVT. atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common form of PSVT. atrioventricular nodal reestrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common form of PSVT and frequently develops in young patients with  a structurally normal heart. palpitations are the most common presentation, but some patients may have dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. 

AVNRT is due to the presence of 2 conduction pathways (slow and fast) in the AV node. Normally, sinus beats are conducted in an antegrade direction through the fast pathway, as antegrade conduction through the slow pathway is extinguished due to the presence of a refractory period. if an atrial premature beat occurs at a critical time when the fast pathway is refractory but the slow pathway is not, it can initiate AVNRT that is then sustained by a reentry mechanism: the slow and the fast pathways form a looped circuit, with impulses traveling in an anterograde direction through the slow pathway and returning through the fast pathway. 

vagal maneuvers (like carotid sinus massage, cold-water immersion or diving reflex, Valsalva maneuver, eyeball pressure) increase parasympathetic tone in the heart and result in a temporary slowing of conduction in the AV node and an increase in the AV node refractory period, leading to the termination of AVNRT 

Coice 2,5,6: vagal stimulation has minimal effect on the Hi-Purkinje system conduction of myocardial contractility. furthermore, the purkinje fibres and the myocardium are not involved in the reentrant pathway responsible for intiation of AVNRT. increased parasympathetic activity increases peripheral vascular capacitance and decrease venous return to the heart, but this decreased venous return does not directly affect the AV node 

although vagal maneuvers decrease sinoatrial node automaticity and cause slowing of the rate of impulse formation from the sinus node, AVNRT termination is due to effects on the reentrant mechanism in the AV node rather than to changes in SA node automaticity (as the SA node is not part of the reentrant pathway)
