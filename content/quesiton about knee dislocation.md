20 year old collegiate footbal player is brought to the emergency due to severe right knee pain following a hard tackle 

he cannot bear weight on the right leg. blood pressure is 142/90, pulse is 108, and resps are 18. the right knee is deformed, swollen and bruied, the lower leg is warm and soft, with a palapable dorsalis pedal pulse. lateral x-ray of the knee reveals a posteriro dislocation. immediate reduction is performed under sedation. which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient? 

1. measure the ankle-brachial idex 
2. perform knee arthrocentesis 
3. perform nerve conduction study 
4. perform posterior drawer test 

so- this patient with severe knee pain and deformity after a hard tackel ahs a postr knee dislocation. this typically results from a direct blow tot hte proximal tibia and disrupts multiple ligaments (cruciate, collateral), with possible injury to to neurovascular structures within the popliteal fossa. i***njury to the popliteal artery is the most feared complication***n of any knee dislocation because the resulting lower leg ischemia can cause irreversible injury, requiring above-the-knee amputation. 

[[ankle-brachial index]]

management begins with immediate reduction of the dislocated knee. given the risk of vascular (popliteal artery) injury, this should be followed by a meticulous vascular examination that includes: 

1. palpation of the popliteal and distal pulses 
2. measurement of the abi 
3. duplex ultrasonography
