60 yo man comes to the office for follow up of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. 

the patient reports that his blood pressure is usually 110-130/70-85 mmHg and his fasting glucose is 85-95 when he measures at home. he has had no headaches, chest pain, or vision changes but reports increased urinary frequency and nocturia 2-3 times per night over the past 3 months. the patient has had no dysuria but says it takes him longer to finish urinating and he often urinates again within 1-2 hours. his current medications are metformin and lisinopril. temp is 37, 122/78. pulse 68. BMI 23. physical examination shows normal fundoscopy findings, normal heart and lung sounds, and a soft non tender abdomen with a palpable bladder. rectal examination reveals a smooth, enlarged prostate with no induration. today's and previous lab results are as follows 

today - 6 months ago - 12 mo - 24 

hba1c - 6 - 5.8 - 6.1 - 6.5 
Scr - 1.5 - 1.3 - 1.1. - 1.0 

urine studies reveal no significant albuminuria, hematuria, or pyuria. which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient? 

1. additional antihypertensive therapy 
2. lisinopril discontinuation 
3. percutaneous kidney biopsy 
4. renal ultrasonography (c)
5. stricter glycemic control 

this patient with lower urinary tract symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia has a slow rising creatinine level, urinalysis does not show evidence of albuminuria, hematuria, or pyuria making instrinsic kidney disease less likely. this presentation rases suspicious for BPH-induced obstructive nephropathy(enlarged prostate, palpable bladder), which may result in permanent kidney damage due to blockage of free flow of urine. 

with obstructive uropathy, a renal ultrasound examination (which should be performed in all patients being evaluated for creatinine elevation or chronic kidney disease) typically reveals hydronephrosus, it can also help assess the extent of kidney injury. if irreversible kidney damage (eg, cortical atrophy on sonogram due to increased pressure) has not yet occure, management of BPH may improve creatinine levels. 

other possible causes of the rising creat are diabetic and hypertensive nephropathies. however, his HbA1c and BP measurements are within goal and he has no evidence of albuminuria or retinopathy. therefore, his creatinine elevation is not likely caused by diabetes or hypertension, and additional antihypertendive therapy and stricter glycemic control are not indicated 

ACEi often cause an elevation in creat level, but this elevation would be rapid and would occur within 3-5 days of starting the medication, not over 1-2 years as seen in this patient 

a kidney biopsy would be appropriate to evaluate flomerular hematuria (red cell casts and dysmorphia), nephrotic syndrome (heavy proteinurua), or other acute kidney damage that has not been explained by less invasiv testing. it can be considered in this patient if renal ultrasonography is unrevealing. however, skipping as ultrasound examination and performaing a biopsy to determine the cause of a rising serum creatinine level in the absence of any additional lab abnormalityies would not be appropriate.
