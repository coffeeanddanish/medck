50 year old man is scheduled to have a surgical procedure to treat colonic carcinoma. 

he has bipolar I disorder, which has been stable with 900 mg of lithium carbonate daily. He has been taking his medication at bedtime for many years, and his lithium level is 0.8 mmol/L (0.6-1.2). Postoperatively, he will receive IV fluids and be unable to eat and drink for a few days. 

which one of the following is the most appropriate management? 

1. replace narcotics with ibuprofen for pain relief 
2. discontinue lithium carbonate until eating and drinking are resumed (c)
3. increase the lithium carbonate dosage to reach a serum level of 1.0 mmol per litre 
4. replace lithium carbonate with valproate during the few postoperative days 
5. monitor hepatic enzymes closely 

lithium carbonate toxicity is associated mostly with factors that change an individual's sodium levels, such as low-salt diets, dehydration and drug interactions. in this case, when the patient is unable to eat or drink for several days postoperatively, there is a risk for dehydration despite receiving IV fluids, therefore, there is a risk for lithium toxicity. the safest management for this patient's case would be to discontinue the lithium carbonate until the patient is eating and drinking again. iburofen could increase the lithium carbonate leve, which could be dangerous perioperatively. increasing the dosage of lithium carbonate in this scenario could also be harmful and put the patient at risk for lithium toxicitiy. the patiet has been stable on lithium carbonate, so switching to valproic acid would not be advisable because it may not be as effective. unlike valproic acid, lithium carbonate is processed through the kidneys and would not affect hepatic enzymes.
