A 41 year old man presens to emergency of a community jospital with a 2-day history of fev er, founl-smelling urine and worsening of his chronic right-sided body numbness 

he has multiple sclerosis with a neurogenic bladder for which he catheterizes himself 5 times daily. Physical exam reveals only decreased pain sensation to his right side. the urinalysis is positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrite, and his WBC count is 14.2E9 (3.5-10.5) with neutrophiles of 12.8E9 (2.0-7.5). In addition to antibiotics, which one of the following is the best next step? 

1. admission for observation (c)
2. transfer to a tertiary care center 
3. lumbar puncture 
4. CT head 
5. methylprednisolone 

UTI are common with MS and may increase problems with bladder dysfunction. Patients with MS and infections should be observed for exacerbation of their disease. Therefore, the patient should be admitted to hospital. The only indication for transfer to a tertiary care center is if more complex treatments are needed. Because there is already a diagnosis of a UTI, a lumbar puncture is not needed. Most patients who have a suspected MS exacerbation should be evaluated with MRI of the brain and spinal cord, not with CT. mild sensory attackks are typically not treated with methylprednisolone.
