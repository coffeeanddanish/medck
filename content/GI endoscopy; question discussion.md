84 yo man presents to the office with symptoms of GERD. 

he states that he has had occasional trouble swalling solid good, especially bread and meat. he denies any vomiting, weight loss, loss of apptetite. he has noticed 2 episodes of black stools in the last month
hi symptoms have improved with the use of otc [[famotideine]].

which one of the following is the best next step? 

1. schedule an urgent ct of the abdomen 
2. discontinue famotidine and prescibe a ppi 
3. order serology for h pylori 
4. refer fr an urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 
5. continue current treatment and follow up in 6 months

dysphagia in older patients or melena are worrisome symptoms that warrant prompt investigation to identify a cause. urgent upper GI endoscopy is required to rule out an esophageal malignancy as the cause of this patient's symptoms. charnging the patient's antacid regimen, testing for h pylori, or scheduling a follow-up in 6 mo are all inadequate treatment plans. an urgent ct of the abdomen will not identify the esophageal pathology
