a 19-year-old patient presents with sore, itchy nipples and breasts for the past 2 weeks. she experiences shooting pains, in her breasts during or just after feeding. prior to this, she had successfully breastfed her 3 month old son. now she finds it hard to cope with the pain. her boyfriend cannot bear to see her in so much pain and has usggested she feed the baby with formula, but she would prefer to presernce if her breasts could be 'fixed' 

on checking your notes, you notice she was prescribed amoxicillin for bronchitis 3 weeks ago, and she developed vaginal candidiasis. physical exam reveals red nipples and surrounding area that are painful to touch

q1: which of the following related to this presentation is NOT true (select upto 2 ans)

a. this is a classical presentation of candidiasis of the breast [I]
b. candidiasis is an uncommon complication of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy [N] 
c. you should examine the baby's mouth to see if oral candidiasis is present 
d. if the baby has oral candidiasis, you would expect to see white plaques and erythema 
e. reviewing the baby's feeding position will assist the situation 
f. taking a swab from the baby's mouth is useful in confirming the diag. 
g. negative swab from the baby's mouth does not exclude candidiasis 
h. only the baby needs to be treated for candida infection, as the nipple is not permamnanently moist [N]
i. the patient should rub miconazole gel on her nipple four times daily after feeding 
j. antifungal preparations should be wiped off before feeding 
k. oral nystatin 500,000 U TDS orally may speed recovery 
l. the nipple area should be kept dry 
m. the patient should change her bra daily 
n. if a dummy/pacifier is used, it should be sterilized in boiling water daily 
o. it is usually caused by candida albicans 
p. the baby should have miconazole gel after four of his feeds, rubbed into his gums and inner cheeks [I]

the correct answer was candidiasis being an uncommon presentation and that only the baby needs candidal treatment and not the mother. how do we know which ones are correct. the questions asks us to choose 2 incorrect answers. could there be more? why did i choose miconazole and classical presentation of breast? 

q2: the patient comes back to see you when the baby is 8 months old, having successfully continued breastfeeding during that time. he slept through the night from 10 weeks to 5 mo, but since then, he has woken early. lately, he has been waking 3 to 4 times a night, reaching out for 'food' and after feeding well, he goes back to sleep. the patient started him on solids at 5 and half months, and now he has three meals daily. 

which of the follwoing questions should you ask? (pick up to 7 answers)

a. where does the baby sleep? [Y] {i}
b. have there been any changes in family lifestyle? [Y] {i}
c. how does the patient put the baby to sleep? [Y] {i}
d. does she include green vegetables in his solid meals? 
e. does the patient rock the baby to sleep? [Y] {i}
f. does the patient use 'controlled crying' with the baby? [Y]
g. does she ever use sedatives to get the baby to sleep? [Y]
h. does the patient let the baby fall asleep at the breast? [Y] {i}
i. does the patient have a healthy diet? {i}
j. does she eat cabbage or onions? 
h. has she had any recurrence of her candida infection? {i}
i. is the baby correctly positioned on the breast? 

I got all but two correct, {i} = means I chose them. why did I choose to ask if the patient has a healthy diet? I asked about recurrence of the candida infection, although I don't understand what this line of questioning is getting at. I wish i had someone to discuss this question with

let's see what final bottom-of-the-page explanation for this case question is 

Candida albicans affecting the breast skin presents as erythematous, scaly lesions of the inframammary or axillary folds. scrapings from the elsions demonstrate fungal elements (filaments and binding cells)

This is a classical presentation of candidiasis of the breast. it is a common complication of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. you should examine the baby's mouth to see if oral candidiasis is present (white plaques and erythema). you should also review positioning and attachment. taking a swab from the baby's mouth may be useful in confirming the diagnosis while being aware that a negative swab does not exclude candidiasis. 

both mother and baby should be treated even if there is no obvious sign in the baby's mouth. instruct the patient to rub miconazole gel (not cream) on each nipple 4x daily after feeding. antifungal gel should be wiped off before the baby feeds. oral nystatin 500,000U twice TDS orally may speed recovery; keep nipple area dry; change bra daily and breast pads after each feed. the baby should have miconazole gel (quarter teaspoon) after four of his feeds, rubbed into his gums and inside cheeks. avoid dummy use and if he has a dummy, sterilize it by boiling daily and replace it weekly. 

The baby has learnt to fall asleep at the breast. when he wakes briefly during the night, he cannot put himself back to sleep but needs something to do it for him. in this case, it is the breastfeeding. *the association between sleeping and breastfeeling needs to be broken to resolve this situation.* This involves teaching the baby to put himself to sleep. the patinet can continue to breastfeed as normal but not let him fall asleep at the breast. she should try a different method ex. rocking, patting. she may need a referral to a mother and child unit to establish a new pattern.
