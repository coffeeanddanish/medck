Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disease that affects 1 in 3000 caucasians. the disease is much rare in asians a blacks. the most common pathology results from a single deletion of 3 base pair coding for the amino acid phenyalanine. the product of the gene is an abnormal protein called cystic fibrosis trns-membrance conductance regulator (CFTR). this abnormality results in intracellular degradation of the protein and thus its absence from the plasma membrane of epithelial cells in the most common mutations in the CFTR gene. however, other mutations in this gene can result in dysfunctional membrane couple proteins.
