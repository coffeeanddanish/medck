what *are* popliteal cysts? also known as baker's cyst, why baking? i dont know, are synovial fluid-filled masses located in the popliteal fossa 

etiology 
classified as primary (distension of the bursa with ***no*** communication to joint) or 
secondary - communication between bursa and joint, so the bursa fills with synovial fluid 

there are priamry and secondary systs 

primary are usually congenital in children 
secondary are acquired from traumatic injury or degenerative/inflammatory joint disease in adults 

clinical features 
(usually) asymptomatic, bulging, located on the posterior aspect of the knee 
usally located between the semimembranosus and medial head of gastronemius 
may cause local tightness, restricted range of motion or posterior knee pain 
symptoms may worsen with physical activity 
for secondary popliteal cysts, symptoms are more associated with the underlying condition of the knee 

investigations 
clinical diagnosis is often enough 
ultrasound can be used to identify th cyst and its relation to adjacent soft tissue structures 
knee x-ray to assess for joint abnormalities that may be associated with the cyst 
MRI allows for clearest visualizaiton but this is only indicated to plan for surgery, when an underlying knee pathology such as meniscal tear is suspected, or when the diagnosis is undertain after ultrasonography 

treatment 
asymptomatic cysts due not require treatment 
non-operative
(1) indications: initial treatment for symptomatic secondary popliteal cysts 
(2) identify and treat underlying cause 
(3) rest, NSAIDs, cold pack for symptomatic treatment 
(4) image guided aspiration and intra-articular steroid injection may offer temporary relief
