a 64 yo man comes to the office for evaluation of leg pain 

the patient underwent a below-the-knee amputation 3 months ago due to a nonhealing plantar ulcer associated with osteomyelitis. he has been trying to be fitted for a walking prosthesis but bearing weight on the stump has caused significant pain. The patient describes the pain as an intermittent burning sensation that has not improved with pain medication. medical history is notable for type 2 DM, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. the patient smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and has 1-2 drinks every night. on physical examination, the amputation incision is well healed and the distal flap has no areas of blanching. there is slight bogginess over the end of the skin flap. gentle pressure over the flap reproduces the pain, which radiates up the leg. which of the following is the most likely cause of this patinet's leg pain? 

1. heterotropic ossification 
2. neuroma (c)
3. osteomyelitis 
4. phantom pain syndrome 
5. stump hematoma 

This patient has intermittent stump pain despite good wound healing following lower extremity amputation. the pain is elicited by focal palpation near the site of operation, which suggests a post-traumatic neuroma. The post-traumatic neuroma is caused by the transection of nerve fibers, which leads to an inflammatory reaction that initiates the formation of a tangle mass of unmyelinated nerve endings. These nerve endings have decreased depolarization thresholds that cause pain signal spontaneously or in response to non-painful stimuli. 

Post-traumatic neuromas form over several weeks to months following injury or amputation. because the pain is worsened by local pressure, neuromas can complicate the fittings for prosthetic devices. the diag. is based primarily on clinical grounds, although, by injecting a local anesthetic, pain can temporarily relieved and at the same time the diagnosis of neuroma will be confirmed. Management of neuroma is by surgical excision, however, TCA and antiepileptic medications can be given presurgery. 

Post-amputation pain 

1) acute stump pain 
2) ischemic pain 
3) post-traumatic neuroma 
4) phantom limb pain 

Acute stump pain, involves tissue and nerve injury and is limited to 1-3 weeks. 

Ischemic pain has three signs. One is swelling and skin discoloration superficially speaking. Wound breakdown. *AND* something known as decreased transcutaneous oxygen tension. Think superficial to deep. 

post-trauamtic neuroma's timeline is from weeks to months, please remember. focal pain, and altered sensation. and pain is temporarily reduced by injecting local anesthetics. 

phantom limb pain - the onset is usually within 1 week. increased risk in patients with severe acute pain. intermittent cramping and burning felt in the distal limb
