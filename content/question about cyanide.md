72 yo man comes to the emergency due to sob, headache and fatige 

he has a history of hypertension, lives alone, and does not regularly take his medications. the patient drinks 1-2 glasses of wine dialy but does not smoke. blood pressure is 184/128 and pulse is 96HR. oxygen saturatino is 90% by pulse oximetry on room air. the patient has early papilledema on fundoscopic examination. pulmonary examination shows bibalisar coarse crackles. 

cardiac examinatino demonstrasted a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border. there is trace pedal edema. chest c-ray reveals mild pulmonary edema. ecg is unchanged from prior tracings. lab studies are normal except for a serum creat 2.0 mg/dL. the patient is given oxygen and furosemide and is presecribed a nitroprusside drip. after 36 hours, blood pressure is 140/80 pulse is 98. and he is no longer dyspneic. however, he is confused and disoriented and has diffuse hyperreflexia. there are no other focal neurologic findings. repeat lab: 

sodium 140 
potassium 4.4 
clhoisrde 100 
bicarboante 14 
creat 2.5 

which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms? 

1. alcohol withdrawal 
2. cyanide toxicitiy (c)
3. global cerebral hypoperfusion 
4. lacunar infarcts 
5. uremic encephalopathy 

[[cyanide poisoning]] 

common etiologies 
-structure fires -> combusion of plastics 
-occupaitonal exposure -> mining 
-cyanide-containing medications -> sodium nitroprusside 

pathophysiology 
-inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and forces anaerobic metabolism 
-rapidly lethat if untreated 

clinical features 
-hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, --> circulatory collapse , and death 
-headache, confusion, anxiety -> seizures and coma 
-cherry red skin 
-evelated anion gap metabolic acidosise with increased lactic acid 

Management
decontamination 
supportive care with oxygen fluids etc 
empric treatment 
-hydroxycobalamin w.w.o sodium thiosulfate 


----- 

this patient with hypertensive emergency was treated with sodium notroprusside, a potent arterial and venous dilator, after 36 hours he developed acute neurologic sypmtoms (eg., confusion, hyperreflexia) and metabolic acidosis, a presentation most concerning for cyanide toxicitiy. sodium nitroprusside contains 5 cyanide groups and undergoes rapid conversion to cyanide. 

cyanide is eventually converted to thiocyanate, which is eliminated by the kidneys, however, especially in patients with renal impairment, prolonged sodium nitroprusside (eg >24 h) can lead to cyanide toxicitiy 

cyanide inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphyrlation. this forces cells to switch to anaerobic metabolism and leads to cellular hypoxia, lactic acid formation, and metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. neurologic symptoms (heachade, confusion) are common due to cerebral cellular hypoxia. hyporreflexia is caused by thiocyanate accumulation. other possible manifestations include cardiovascular and respiratory instability, gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting, and reddish skin.
