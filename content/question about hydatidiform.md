41 yo woman comes tot th eemergency due to heavy vaginal bleeding 

her last menstrual period was 4 days ago, but she has had irregular spotting since. earlier today, the patient began to have increasingly heavy veginal bleeding with passage of small clots and pelvic pain. she also has had increasingly hot flashed, night sweat and palpitations over the past 3 weeks but no chest pain, shortness of breath or orthopnea. the patient had a roux-en-y gastric bypass 7 years ago and has lost 45 kg. she is sexually active and was treated for PID 6 mo ago. temp is 37.7, blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 118. BMI is 35. physcial examination shows the patient to be anxious. the skin is warm and smooth. cardiac examination reveals tachycardia but a regular rhythm. the lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. pelvic examination reveals an enlarged uterus with the fundus 4 cm below the umbilicus. a fetal heartbeat is unable to be identified by doppler. tsh is 0.1, serum b-hcg is elevated. which is the most likely diag? 

1. ectopic pregnancy 
2. endometrial cance 
3. hydatidiform mole 
4. inevitable abortion 
5. sarcoma botryoides 
6. struma ovarii 

Although this is a long question, many points are clues to the main diagnosis, but not all of them are required to know. The first question is, since it is elevated b-hcg - in which conditions do we see it. Ectopic and molar is the top two. the thing to remember is that extopic pregnancy 1) causes pain 2) does not yield a uterine enlargement, otherwise it wont be ectopic! 

the gastric surgery hints to a vitamin deficiency which is a risk factor for molar pregnancy. 

b-hcg and thyroxine are molecularly similar, therefore in a question stem with these two values, put molar above other differentials. hot flashes, tachycardia blah blah is hyperthyroidism due to compensations. .... 

rationale for wrong answers: 

sarcoma botryoides, typically presents in infancy and early childhoos as non-friable nodules protruding from the vagina that look a cluster of grapes. 

struma ovarii - an ovarian germ cell tumor comprising of >50% mature thyroid tissue, can secrete thyroid hormone and cause hyperthyroidism. however, patients typically have an ovarian mass, not uterine enlargement. In addition, bet-HCG levels are not elevated. 

lets talk about the hydatidiform mole now: 

how does it present clinically? starting from most noticeable to least -- abnormal vaginal bleeding w/w/o hydropic tissue, uterine enlargement, hyperthyroid features 

--now there is also mention of morning sickness and preeclampsia with severe features. What would be the severe fts of preeclampsia? if they are consequences of hypertension, how does it manifest, and how acute is it? lab wise we have elevated b-hcg --- and as we have seen -- there is also crossover with TSH ; and finally we have theca lutein ovarian cysts 

risk factors: advanced maternal and hx of molar pregn. 

diagnosis : 'snowstorm' appearnace on ultrasound 
beta-hcg levels and uterine contents - so that would be i think theca lutein cysts 

management is D&C
