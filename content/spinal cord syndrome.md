[[american spinal injury assc. impairment scale]]

to understand, first we must recall the UMN vs LMN lesions. QID 3784 is the reason for this topic. but how to deal with it, is not understood by me. 

the patient who fell headfirst intot the ........ now has altered sensation and quadriplegia --> this is consistent with cervical spinal cord trauma. that's how you know this is an NS question. 

as for any trauma patient, his evaluation should begin with a [[primary survey]]. 

1. because he is alert with normal respirations, he does not need further airway protection 
	1. orotracheal intubation 
	2. mechanial ventialtion 
	3. etc etc 
2. is the patient hemodynamically stable / good IV bore access will be needed for resusc. 
3. GROSS motor exam shows quadriplegia, THEREFORE, you need to do a detailed neurologic examination 
	1. neuro exam shows no pain and temp (spinothalamic)
		1. bilateral paralysis -- lat. corticospinal tract 
		2. DC is good - vibration intact 

So, we can conclude that these findings are consistent with ***anterior cord syndrome**

reason: posteriorly displaced C5 fragments causing direct spinal cord trauma or anterior spinal artery injury. 

**anterior cord syndrome, (and other severe cord injuries) can disrupt the autonomic tracts involved in bladder control - leading to acute urinary retention** therefore catheterization was the answer

QID 3784 
A 20 yo hockey player is brought to the emergency 30 minutes after falling headfirst into the hockey rink boards...

* he did not lose consciousness during the impact but was unable to move his arms and legs **quadriplegia** afterward. the patient was placed in a rigid cervical collar and transported to the hospital on a backboard.
* 2 large bore iv catheters were inserted en route. on arrival, blood pressure is 128/78 pulse is 102 and resp are 14. the patient is alert and appears anxious. cardiopulm exam is normal. 
* neurologic examination shows *intact cranial nerves*. pinprick and temp sensation are absent below the level of clavicles. vibration is intact 
* the patinet is still unable to move his extremities 
* CT scan of the cervical spine reveals a burst fracture of C5 with impingment of posteriorly displaced fragments on the spinal cord. 
* neurosurgery is consulted. 

next step? 

1. administer oral prednison 
this is an NPO patient until neurosurgical consult
2. bladder catheterization 
3. femoral line placement 
4. nasogastric tube insertion 
5. orotracheal intubation 

Wrong answers 

femoral line indications? 	
indications for a femoral line:
inadequate peripheral venous access 
need for hemodynamic monitoring
vasopressor infusion

NG tube indications 
GI decompression - ileus bowel obstruction 
administration of medication when unconscious (or inability to swallow)
