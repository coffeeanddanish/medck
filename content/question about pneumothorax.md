you are called to the bedside of a 72 yo woman on mechanical ventilation for three days who suddenly develops chest pain. her face is contorted with pain, and she points to her chest 

she has a 40 pack year history of smoking and long-standing COPD. 

vital signs show blood pressure of 85/55, HR 120, RR 24 and oxygen sat of 80% with a fiO2 of 40$. physical exam reveals absent breath sounds over the left side of the chest with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without any murmurs. 

what is the next best step in the management of this patient: 

1. insert a chest tube in the left 5th intercostal space in the midaxillary line 
2. insert a large-bore needle into the left 5th intercostal space, midaxillary line (c)
3. insert a needle under the xiphoid process directed upward and to the patient's left 
4. obtain chest CT 
5. obtain CXR

a history of mechanical ventilation, especially in addition to underlying lung pathology, and a physical exam showing absent breath sounds on one side of the chest suggests a diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. this patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneaic, so this is a medical emergency. before any other imaging or intervention is attempted, an immediate needle thoracostomy is performed by inserting a 16-18 gauge needle intot he 5th IC space midaxillary lineor in the midclavicular line thorugh the second intercostal space of the affected side is required to treat this patient (2018 Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines). Once this has been accomplished, a rush of air out of the pleural space is expected. Following needle thoracostomy, a chest tube can be inserted, and a chest X-ray can be performed. 

inserting chest tube into the 5th IC space in the midaxillary line should be done after the initial needle thoracostomy, as the needle decompression can cause a simple pneumothorac, which can be treat with chest tube insertion. when a chest tube is inserted, it should be inserted above the rib, as the neurovascular bundle can be struck if insertion occurs below the rib 

pericardiocentesis - inserting a needle under the xiphoid process, upward and leftward is incorrect, as this patient does not have cardiac tamponade. the dx of tamponade would require hypotension, decreased heart sounds, and distended neck veins as well as lungs should be clear to auscultation, which are not seen in this patient 

obtaining chest CT - would be inappropriate at this time as this patient is clinically unstable (hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia) and needs immediate treatment. in the context of pneumothorax a chest CT can be used if there is clinical uncertainty and the patient is stable 

obtaining cxr does need to be done, but the first step is needle thoracostomy. had a cxr been performed, it would have down deviation of the trachea to the right (the side opposite to the pneumothorax) as well as increased radiolucency on the left chest. 

Key points: 

sudden onset of chest pain and decreased or absent breath sounds on one side suggest tension pneumothorax. the first step in treatment is the insertion of a large-gauge needle intot he fifth intercostal space midaxillary line or in the midclavicular through the 2nd intercostal space.
