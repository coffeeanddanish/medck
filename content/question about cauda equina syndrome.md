a 30 year old man presented to emergency with severe low back pain. 

a week ago, he felt a sharp, shooting pain in the back radiating to the buttocks and legs after moving some boxes. he was careful not to over-exert himself since and he began to feel better. however, he woke up today with numbness in the buttock region and right leg weakness 

on physical examination, the back was non-tender on palpation, and straight-leg raise test to 30 degrees did not elicit additional pain in either leg. motor strength of the right lower extremity was decreased to 3/5 in the hamstrings and quadriceps, and right patellar and ankle reflexes were absent. sensory examination showed hypoesthesia of the perineum and reduced anal sphincter tone. 

based on the patient's presentation, magnetic resonance imaging is ordered. what findings are most likely to be seen by the radiologist. 

1. hemisection of the spine 
2. herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum 
3. impingement of the thoracic spine 
4. narrowing of the vertebral canal in lumbar and sacral spine 
5. ventricular enlargement proximal to obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid

cauda equina syndrome is caused by compression or irritation of the lumbosacral nerve roots below conus medullaris (below L2) and decreased space in the vertebral canal below L2. it is commonly caused by herniated disc with or without spinal stenosis, vertebral fracture, and tumor. symptoms are usually acute and affect all three neuro types: motor, sensory and autonomic. lower motor signs include weakness/paresis and reduced deep tendon reflexes (patellar and/or ankle). sensory involvement includes low back pain radiating to legs, sensory loss or pain and saddle (S2-S5) anasthesia. patients may also present with urinary retention and/or fecal incontinence due to loss of anal sphincter tone 

CES is a syndrome that often mimics disc herniation or spinal stenosis, but saddle anesthesia and vesicular or rectal dysfunction are warning signs that differentiate CES from less serious causes back pain. urgen investigation and decompression of the affected area are necessary in order to preserve bowel, bladder and sexual function as well as prevention of possible progression to paraplegia. this is a medical emergency thus requires prompt treatment. 

MRI is currently the study of choice in evaluating patients with suspected CES. however, it is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers, aneurysm clips and metal fragments neal vital organs. CT with myelography can also be used as an alternative. MRI findings in patients with CES typically show compression and/or narrowing of the vertebral canal in the lower lumbar and sacral regions which can be confused with disc herniation or spinal stenosis. therefore, patient history plays an important role in distinguishing CES from common causes of back pain. 

hemisection of the spine results in Brown-Sequard syndrome 
herniation of cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum is associated with Arnold Chiari Type 1 malformation which accounts for 70% of syringomyelia cases but not CES 
impingement of throacic spine is seen in disc herniation but CES affects lumbar and sacral spine, not throacic 
ventricular enlargement proximal to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the brain is present in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and not CES. common findings for NCH includes the triad 1) ataxia/apraxia 2) urinary incontinence, and dementia
