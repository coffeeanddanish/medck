"This patient has a history of cancer, amenorrhea, and signs of estrogen deficiency (vaginal dryness), consisten with ovarian failure secondary to chemotherapy. hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in women over the age of 40, also known as primary ovarian insufficiency, occurs due to the absence of developing follicles. chemotherapy and radiation target rapidly dividing cancer cells but also affect the proliferating granulosa and theca cells of the ovary. patients undergoing cancer treatment often have transient amenorrhea but have an overall shortened reproductive capacity even if menses return. Ovarian failure results in ***decreased estrogen*** thereby decreasing negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary and resulting in increased FSH and LH production. treatment with hosrmore replacement therapy provides menopausal symptom relief and bone loss protection. gertility preservation may be possible with cryopreservation techniques prior to treatment onset"
