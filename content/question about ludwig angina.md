54 yo man comes to the emergency after 2 days of fever, chills, dysphagia and drooling. 

the patient has been unable to eat or drink due to pain in his mout and neck. he has a hisotyr of heavy alcohol use but done not use recreational drugs. temp is 38.8C, blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 108, resps are 22. the patient appears toxic with drooling and a muffled voice. the tongue is displaced posteriorly and superiorly due to a swollen area on the floor of the mouth. the bilateral submandibular area is tender, indurated, and nonfluctuant with palpable crepitus. which of the following is the most likely source of infection in this patient? 

1. bloodstream 
2. epiglottis 
3. lymph nodes 
4. palatine tonsils 
5. parotid glands 
6. teeth roots (c)

This is a case of cellulitis in the submandibular space. It rapidly spreads to submylohyoid and sublingual space. This kind of progressive cellulitis is known as Ludwig's angina. Originates from dental infections - the actual pathogen can be more than one - we say polymicrobial: which will be oral bacteria like viridans streptococci and anaerobics. 

patients have 2 forms of symptoms: one is systemic - so you might have fever, malaise, chills; second is local and cmopressive - therefore, what you will see is pain, drooling, dysphagia, airway compromise - the voice may be muffled. 

Next step is CT scan of neck. Rule out abscess, and confirm diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. The presentation is very florid with mass effect and history of fever and chills. The treatment is removal of the teeth, and IV antiobiotics - so clindamycin, ampicillin-sulbactam. 

Drainage and surgery is rarely required, process is cellulitic and typically non-suppurative.
