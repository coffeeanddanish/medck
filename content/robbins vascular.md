so like, there are three layers to the blood vessel right? We are talking about the arteries mainly. There's the tunica intima, media and adventitia. Tunica, like tunic, means layer (i guess, even though strata means layer, I suppose 'covering' is more appropriate, so like a tunic would be a covering of fabric over you), so there's intima and media that are the most interesting, the adventitia is the outermost covering, ~~it has the nerve (if its passing along with it)~~ and the vasa vasorum. 

so the intima is actually covered by a layer of endothelial cells. then between the intima and media is a layer of connective tissue and it is elastic. and this elastic connective tissue, the internal elastic lamina, has pores for oxygen to traverse into the media. the media is made of smooth muscle cells. So they do the work of vasoconstriction and vasodilation. the large arteries, the elastic arteries, contain elastin in the tunica media, which as age progresses, depletes. therefore, hypertension comes on in older age. 

the medium arteries are all arteries down to 2 milimeter width or diameter. Under that, the small arteries form. then from 20-100 micrometer is arteriole. anyway, the interweave of smooth muscles in medium-sized (muscular) arteries is spiral. This is how contraction is done.
