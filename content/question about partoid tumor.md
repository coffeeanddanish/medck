56 year old man comes to the office for evaluation of gradually enlarging, painless mass above the right angle of the jaw.

He has also recently experienced right-sided weakness. when he was in his 20s, the patient has Hodgkin's that was treated with radiation to the neck. Family history is significant for thyroid cancer in his mother. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. He had several male and female sexual partners in his 30s but has been sexually active with one one partner for the past 15 years. vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a firm non-tender mass in the right parotid gland and weakness of all right-sided facial muscles. which of the following is the mot concerning for malignancy? 

1. exposure to oncogenic virus 
2. family hostpry of malignancy 
3. lack of salivary gland pain 
4. origin from parotid gland 
5. presence of facial droop (c)

Lets understand a few things 
physical exam yielded a firm, non-tender mass - now the differentials for exactly this location and mass of such a type is important to know. 
Secondly, 
what has the patient come with? what are those 2 words 
gradually enlarging and painless 

then when the history was taken, it was found that: 
-he had hodgkin's lymphoma in his 3rd decade of life which was treated with radiation (only? was there chemo was there surgery?)
-his mother had thyroid carcinoma (which kind/does it matter?)

thirdly, let's address the facial droop 
-after reading the stem- you know that there is a cranial nerve involvement due to the mass - or something to do with the mass 

Most parotid neoplasms are beningn - but this patient comes with a risk factor of hodkins-related radiation therapy history 

anatomical knowledge about the cranial nerve in the vicinity of parotid gland -- 7 and 5 
7 is facial droop and 5 is numbness (sensory)

"As a result, all patients with parotid masses undergo detailed cranial nerve examination. Imaging (CT or MRI) is typically performed. Ultrasound is often used to enable fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Parotid tumors represent a diverse range of pathologies, including primary parotid neoplasms, lymphomas, or metastases (eg. squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma). Surgical resection with sparing of the facial nerve is typically recommended, with possible additional surgery or adjuvent treatment depending on the final histopathologic diagnosis."

Rationale for wrong answers: 

Firstly, the first option "exposure" to oncogenic viruses means risk of HPV due to his history of bisexual sex in his early life. "Having multiple sexual partners is associated with a risk of infection with human papilloma virus, which is an oncogenic virus implicated in the head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma. it is not associated with salivary gland malignancies"

family history of thyroid - there are not associated. what is, is MEN - thyroid 

Lack of pain - "Pain and firmness (or lack thereof) are not reliable indicators of malignancy in parotid tumors. pain benign neoplasms can occur with associated infection, hemorrhage, or cystic enlargement. in malignant tumors, pain usually indicated neural invasion"

The question is asking which option is the most concerning malignancy. now the last option is origin - that is - the parotid gland where the tumor is originating. Now lets understand that this location is >80% associated with a benign form of neoplasia. 

BUT! carnial nerve dysfunction IS the right answer because it raises the concern for malignancy - how? idk but i hope someone will answer us that
