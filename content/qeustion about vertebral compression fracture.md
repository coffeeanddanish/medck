67 yo man comes ot the office due to 2 days of back pain

the patient was moving boxes in his garage when the pain started. it is not relieved by lying down and increases in intensity when he straing or coughs. the patient cannot sleep due to pain and has taken acetaminophen several times a week without relief. he has never before had such pain. 

physicial examination shows 2+ symmetric knee and ankle jerk reflex. straight leg test is negative. there is point tenderness to palpation and percussion along the midline at the L4. which of the following ...: 

1. apophyseal joint arthritis 
2. intervertebral disc degeneration 
3. ligamentous sprain 
4. loss of bone mineral density (c)
5. nerve root demyelination 

this older patient has acute back pain consistent with vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Acute CVF commonly occurs from minor trauma, such as lifting, twisting, coughing, or falling from standing height. pain is typically localized to the midline, although it can radiate to the flank or upper abdome, pain other worses with movement, coughing or straining and may persist at night. 

examination typically demonstrates vertebral point tenderness, spinal cord or nerve root compression is rare. and patients usually do not have neurologic deficits. 

CVF is most commonly due to **decreased mone density from osteoporosis** 

the risk is greatest in postmenopausal women and men >65 

other etiologies could be: osteomalacia, vertebral osteomyelitis, malignancy with bony mets, metabolic abnormalities and trauama. 

the diagnosis is usually established with plain x ray of the spine, MRI or CT scan are also effective is the diagnosis is uncertain or underlying malignancy is likely. imaging commonly identifies additional asymptomatic compressions. initial evaluation should also include screening studies to identify additional contributing factors: hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin d deficiency 

DXA should also be obtained to guide chronic management
