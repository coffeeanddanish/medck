70 yo man comes to the emergency due to a painful right foot for a day 

the patient has a 2 year history of right sided intermittent caludication to pad. medical hs is significant for hypeternsion, type 2, and ckd. the patient smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years and stopped 2 years ago. blood pressure is 142/92 and pulses 110. the right foot is cool and pale with slow capillary refill. the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses are not palpable. the patient is admitted to the hospital and an intravenous heparin indusion is started. urgent lower exptremity angiography reveals a right popliteal artery aneurysm with an occlusive thrombus for which a surgical thrombectomy is performed. a day later, the patient is found to have significantly worsening renal function. review of the chart shows no significant shanges to blood pressure during hospitalization. labs: 

admission - day 2 - day 3 
BUN - 16 - 38 - 44
SCr - 1.5 - 1.8 - 2.3 

Urinalysis shows 1+ protein and no blood, white blood cells, or red blood cells. urine microscopy examination shows a few muddy brown, granular casts. which of the following the most likely diagnosis? 

1. acute interstitial nephritis 
2. cholesterol atheroembolism 
3. contrast-associated acute kidney injudry (c)
4. renal artery stenosis 
5. rhabdomyolysis 

this patient with a popliteal artery thrombus has developed acute kidney injury a day following arterial contrast administration and surgical thrombectomy, findings indicative of contrast associated AKI. CA-AKI typically develops 24-48 hours after the receipt of arterial contrast and thought to be due to the following: 

- direct effects causing prerenal vasoconstriction, leading to renal hypoxia and cellular injury 
- direct cytotoxicity causing mild acute tubular necrosis 

CA-AKI is a clinical diagnosis; kidney biopsy is typically not required. consistent lab finding sinclude a fena <1% (likely due to prerenal vasoconstriction) and muddy brown, granular casts on urine microscopy. the AKI usually resolves within 3-7 days with supportive care. 

risk factors for CA-AKI include ckd (particularly diabetic nephropathy), a high contrast load, hypovolemia, and NSAID use. prevention involved optimizing renal perfusion (eg., administering 0.9% IV saline), holding NSAIDs, and using the lowest possible volume of contrast

contrast-associated acute kidney injury 

presentation 
1. highest risk with arterial iodinated contrast (coronary angiogram)
2. creatinine elevation 24-48h after contrast exposure, gradually returning to baseline within 3-7 days 
3. clinical diagnosis based on timing and trajectory above (biopsy rarely needed)
risk factors 
1. preexisting chronic kidney disease (esp. diabetic nephropathy)
2. decreased kidney persfusion due to (NSAIDs, hypovolemia, venous congestion)
3. high contrast load 
pathophysiology 
1. prerenal vasoconstriction and direct tubular cytotoxicity 
2. prerenal state (FeNA <1%) with concurrent necrosis (muddy brown casts)
prevention 
1. optimizing kidney perfusion (eg. IV saline, avoidance of NSAID)
2. minimize contrast load 


rationale for wrong answers 

1. acute interstitial nephritis is an inflammatory hypersensitibity repsonse that can occur in response to certain medication (NSAID and antibiotics). it affects the renal interstitium, almost always resulting in pyuria and occasionaly white blood cell casts and hematuria on urinalysis. it is unlikely in this patient with urinalysis remarkable for only 1+ protein and muddy brown casts 
2. cholseterol atheroembolism: can occur due to mechanical disruption of atherosclerotic plaque during vascular intervention and can lead to AKI. however, AKI is a risk only during procedures proximal to the renal blood supply, (eg., coronary angio, upper aorta) and is not expected following vascular intervention in the lower extremities. Furthernore, AKI due to cholesterol embolization is typically delayed, manifesting a week or more follwoing vascular intervention 
3. renal artery stenosis progresses slowly over years and contributes to the development of ckd (rather than AKI) due to gradually reduced blood dlow 
4. rhabdomyolusis is muscle cell damage that can lead to AKI but it causes a false-positive test for blood on urinalysis.
