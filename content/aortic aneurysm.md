when we study aortic aneurysm, let's first understand it is not all about rupture but can also be thrombosis/embolism, erosion and fistula. secondly, lets understand the characteristic of the aneurysm. what would qualify as an aneurysm? more than 1.5 times the normal diameter, anything 3 cm or more is a dilatation 

now there is (true) complete and (false) incomplete or pseudoaneurysm, based on involvement of the vessel walls. complete involves intima, media and adventitia; incomplete involves a portion of the blood vessel wall, there is a breach in intima and media and blood collects between the space of media and adventitia 

when it comes to classification, we discuss the shape and the location of the aneursym 

shape: 
fusiform 
saccular 

fusiform is concentric and involves the whole circumference and all three layers of aorta,
whereas saccular is "eccentric", and is asymmetrical in a manner of speaking. therefore, theoretically speaking, the risk of rupture is worse with saccular due to this "unequal distribution of pressure"

location: 
we have thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA) which can affect three regions: ascending, transverse arch and descending 

next is abdominal, and the varieties are named in relation to the kidney: 
suprarenal
pararenal 
juxtarenal
infrarenal 

infra is the most common, at 90% occurence. suprarenal is above the renal artery (when we say in relation to 'kidney' it more specifically means to the level of the renal artery) and does not invovle the thoracic aorta. para and juxta exist, but there is even more important information to know than the varieties

first and foremost, what happens when an aortic aneurysm ruptures? what do we see?
(1) hypotension (collapse, maybe), (2) pain (front or back), (3) mass (abdominal mass). this is the triad for an aortic aneurysm 

what would the immediate treatment be? it would be placing large bore IVs and increasing systolic pressure to maintain mental state of the patient
