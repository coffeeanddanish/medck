31 yo previously healthy woman is evaluated for 6 week history of periorbital edema and abdominal distention 

Blood pressure is 125/75 and pulse 80 min, physical examination shows moderate ascites and lower extreminty edema. urinalysis shows proteinuria with a 24 hour urinary protein excretion of 4g/day. total serum protein is 5 g/dL and serum albumin is 2.5 

the patient is advised to follow a low sodium diet, an oral diuretic is prescribed and kidney biopsy is scheduled. several days before the procedure the patient experiences sudden onset severe right flank pain and gross hematuria. 

which of the following is the most likely cause of her current symptoms? 

1. acute interstitial nephritis 
2. acute pyelmonephritis 
3. pigment nephropathy 
4. renal cyst rupture {i}
5. renal vein thrombosis (c)

This patient's sudden onset flank pain and hematuria in the setting of nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria over 3.5 grams a day), hypoalbuminemia, and generalized edema - should raise suspicious for acute renal vein thrombosis. the risk of RVT and other thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) is increased in nephrotic syndrome due to hypercoagulability caused by urinary loss of anticoagulant proteins (eg. antithrombin III). The renal vein's predisposition to thrombosis may be due to hemoconcentration (ie, higher viscosisty) of the postglomerular circulation that results from glomerular fluid loss. 

although RVT is more often chronic and asymptomatic, acute RVT typically causes findings of renovascular congestion (flank pain), increased glomerular pressure (hematuria), and/or renal infarction (elevated lactate dehydrogenase); acute kidney injury may result when RVT is bilateral. Patients with nephrotic syndrome require a high index of suspicion for RVT given that its typical presenting symptoms (flank pain, hematuria) overlap with more common disorders (like nephrolithiasis). RVT risk (and that of other thromboembolic events) is increased by all causes of nephrotic syndrome but appears highest with membrane nephropathy. 

diagnosis is typically confirmed using CT or MR angio, ~~although invasive renal venography is sometimes needed~~ 

All patients should be treated with anticoagulation ([[warfarin]]), patients with AKI benefit from urgent clot removal (thrombolysis, thrombectomy)

[[renal vein thrombosis]]

causes 
hypercoagubality  
nephrotic syndrome (particularly membranous nephropathy)
malignancy (esp. RCC)
other (inherited thrombophilia, OCP)

trauma 

clinical features 
acute - renal infarction symptoms 
	- flank pain , hematuria , high LDH, increased kidney size on imaging 
 chronic 
	 - renal symtpoms typically absent -- there may be a PE 

diagnosis 
CT scan or MR angion \renal venography 

treatment 
anticoagulation 
local thrombolysis or thrombectomy
