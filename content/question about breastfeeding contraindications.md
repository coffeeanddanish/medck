breast milk is the ideal for of nutrition for the first 6 months of life, and exclusive breastfeeding is strongly recommended. breastfeeding has advantages both for the mother (decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancers) and newborns (immunity)

although this mother has a history of polysubstance use disorder, breastfeeding is not contraindicated becuase she is adherent to methadone maintenance therapy with a negative drug screen for other substances apart from opioids. concentrations of methadone in breastmilk are low, and breastfeeding can be encouraged regardless of the prescribed dose. in addition, newborns of mothers taking methadone during pregnancy are at increased risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (withdrawal from in utero exposure to opioids). breastfeeding decreases the duration and severity of symptoms in these newborns.
