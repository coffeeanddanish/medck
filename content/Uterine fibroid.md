a 48 year old woman presents with symptoms of increased mentrual bleeding for the past 3-4 cycles. she states that her periods not only are greater in menstrual flow, but they also last longer. she adds that she has been feeling very weak and constantly tired lately. she decided to see you because in addition to everything else she started experiencing pain in her pelvic area. she notices that she has been going to the bathroom more often as well. 

on physical exam, you notice that her abdomen looks like hse is a few months pregnant. however, she tells you that it would be impossible since she has not been sexually active for over two years. 

q1: you suspect fibromyoma. what are the main risk factors associated with this condition? (5)

1. hypertension 
2. family history [Y]
3. diabetes 
4. high cholesterol 
5. OCP 
6. PID {i}
7. endometriosis {i}
8. smoking 
9. pregnancy 
10. nulliparity [Y]
11. multiparity 
12. alcohol use 
13. illicit drug use 
14. low BMI 
15. obesity [Y]
16. early menarche [Y] {x}
17. asian race 
18. black race [Y]
19. white race 

the correct answers ([Y]) are family history, nulliparity, obesity, early menarche and black race. studying from [[fibroids]], I got most of the answers apart from early menarche, and the wrong answers were pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis. I am a little surprised but would be interested to find out why those would be excluded as risk factors. 

q2: what are the most important diagnostic tests that you will order to investigate this condition further? (3)

1. ABG 
2. amylase/lipase 
3. bilirubin 
4. BUN/creat. 
5. CBC
6. Basic metabolic panel (BMP)
7. Complete metabolic panel (CMP)
8. lipid panel 
9. coagulation panel 
10. fasting blood glucose 
11. beta-HCG
12. HbA1c 
13. LH/FSH
14. FOBT (fecal occult blood test)
15. PT/PTT/INR
16. TSH/FT4 
17. urinalysis 
18. EKG 
19. X-ray, abdomen 
20. CT, chest 
21. CT, abdomen 
22. ultrasound, transvaginal 
23. ultrasound, pelvic 
24. mammogram 

the answers are CBC, ultrasound of pelvis and transvaginal 

Which of the following would be acceptable treatment options for this patient's most likely diagnosis? (4)

1. myomectomy [Y]
2. LEEP
3. oophorectomy 
4. salpingectomy 
5. antibiotics 
6. estrogen 
7. progesterone 
8. hysterectomy [Y]
9. narcotics 
10. vitamin D
11. calcium 
12. anti-fungals 
13. gardasil 
14. [[Lupron]] [Y]
15. OCP 
16. prostaglandins 
17. endometrial ablation [Y] 

Detailed explanation 

uterine fibroids, also called fibromyomas, fibromas, myofibromas, leiomyomas and myomas, are in the uterus and are the most common benign tumor of the female repsoductive tract. by age 45, about 70% of women develop a fibroid. many fibroids are small and cause no symptoms. but about 1/4th of white women and one half of black women have fibroids that cause symptoms. fibroids are more common among women who are overweight. 

what causes fibroids to grow in the uterus is unknown. high estrogen and progesterone levels seem to stimulate their growth. thus, fibroids often grow larger during pregnancy and, to a lesser extent, before menopause, and they shrink after menopause. if fibroids grow too large, they may not be able to get enough blood. as a result, they begin to degenerate. 

fibroids may be microscopic or as large as a baseball. they may grow in different parts of the uterus, usually in the wall, which has three layers: 

within the wall of the uterus (intramural) 
just under the inner layer (lining or endometrium) of the uterus known as submucosal fibroids 
on the outside of the uterus (which is known as subserosal fibroids)

some fibroids grow from a stalk (alled pedunculated fibroids). Fibroids that grow in the wall or just under the endometrium can distort the shape of the interior of the uterus. sually, more than one fibroid is present. 

the following factors have been assc. with the presence of fibroids: hereditary, obesity, nulliparity, eary menarche (prior to age 10), Black, women of reproductive age
