76 yo woman comes to the emergency with a 6 day history of lower abdominal pain 

she also has mild nausea without vomiting. medical history includes osteoarthritis and chronic constipation. current medications include topical diclofenac and docusate as needed. temperature is 38.5C, blood pressure is 144/92, and HR 90. physical examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness on deep palaption 

Hb: 13.5 
Plates: 455,000 {per cu. mm = 10^9} N=150-400
leukocytes: 14.5 N=4.5-11

CT scan of the abdomen reveals sigmoid diverticula, local thickening of the colon wall, and parasignoid fat sctranding along with a 5 cm rim-enhancing parasigmoidal fluid collection. which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient? 

1. IV antibiotics and percutaneous abscess drainage (c)
2. IV broad spectrum abx and observation {i}
3. laparotomy for colon resection 
4. laparotomy for draining and debridement 
5. oral antibiotics, liquid diet, and outpatient follow-up 

Okay, the thing to note here is that <4cm absceses do not require surgery. Let's begin...

Let us first see again what the CT scan shows. The other information is not as significant for answering the question: 

The ct shows: firstly it confirms the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis 
the diagnosis was based on LLQ pain, fever and leukocytosis 

"CT scan can confirm the diagnosis; typical findings include localized colon wall thinckening and pericolonic soft tissue (fat) stranding. Visible diverticula are helpful diagnostic signs but are not necessary or sufficient to make the diagnosis"

Here, all findings are clearly given in the question: this lady has local thickining, fat stranding, and a "rim-enhancing parasigmoid 5-cm fluid collection"

Rationale for next step "small abscess less than 4 cm often respond to IV antibiotic therapy alone without drainag, but larger abscesses will require drainage. a percutaneous drain can be placed under CT or u/s guidance and leads to clinical improvement within 48 hours in most cases"

Algorithm 

- acute pain and CT showing bowel wall thickening w/w/o visible diverticula 
	1. no high risk ft or complications 
		- outpatient: oral fluids w/w/o abx
	2. high risk: age >70, comorbidities, immunosuppression, SIRS (systemic inflammatory response), sepsis 
		- inpatient management: bowel rest, IV fluid
	3.  complications 
		- abscess
				- IV abx and drainage perc. 
		- perforation obstruction fistula 
				- iv abx and surgery
