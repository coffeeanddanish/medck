a 28 yo woman G2P1 at 24 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. 

she has had increasing shortness of breath but no cough or chest pain. the patient has had no vaginal bleding, leakage of fluid, or contractions. fetal movement is normal. she no chronic medical conditions. and her only prior surgery is a c-section with her first pregnancy. the patient had a fetal anatomy ultrasound at 19 weeks gestation, but not all structures were well visualized. blood pressure is 116/70, pulse is 68. fundal height is 32cm. ultrasound reveals and AFI of 40cm (N=8-24). the fetus is in breech presentation and has an estimated fetal size consistent with 24 weeks gestation. an isolated tracheoesophageal fistula is visualized. the placenta is located posteriorly. the patient is at increased risk for which of the following obstetric complications? 

1. placenta accreta 
2. postterm pregnancy 
3. preeclampsia 
4. preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (c)
5. shoulder dystocia

this patient has [[polyhydramnios]], an excessive AFI >24, due to the TEF. because of that, the fetus cannot swallow the fluid, and the pressure on the membrane increases. most patient with polyhydramnios are asymptomatic and have a uterine size-larger-than-dates discrepancy -- at 24 weeks = the fundal height should be 32 cm) - this enlargement may cause pressure on the thorax and lead to dyspnea in the mother. 

learning points are: fundal height by week, [[amniotic fluid index]] (rewrite), uterus

few things to understand about uterine overdistension: 

it may also cause inflammation, prostaglandin release, uterine irritability and an increased risk of preterm labor. complications are everywhere. and they have a wide overlap with any condition - so there could be fetal malpresentation, umpilical cord prolapse,and postpartum uterine atony.
