a 65 year old man with exertional chest pain and an abnormal exercise stress test comes to the hospital for elective cardiac cathereization. the patient has no resting chest pain or shortness of breath. he has no known allergies. temperature is 37C (986.F), blood pressure is 130/78, 84HR, and resp is 15. pulse oximetry shows 98% on room air. examination shows normal jugular venous pressure, clear lungs without crackles, normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and a normal capillary refill time. 
10 minutes after the first injection of iodinated contrast during cardiac catheterization, the patient reports chest pain, abdominal pain, and dizziness; then he suddenly becomes obtunded and flushed. BP is 70/36, HR is 128, rep is 32. Pulse ox is 90% on 2L via nasal cannula. 

which of the following hemodynamic changes are most likely present in this patient at this time 

Central venous pressure - pulmonary capillary wedge pressure - systemic vascular resistance 

1. decreased - decreased - decreased 
2. decreased - decreased - increased 
3. increased - decreased - increased 
4. increased -increased - increased 

the answer is 1. 

After recieving iodinated contrast, this patient developed chest pain, abdominal pain, dizziness, obtundation, flushed skin, hypotension and respiratory distress, findings concerning for anaphylaxis. a widespread IgE-mediated release of inflammatory mediatros (like histamine) in response to an allergen (like food or insect bite) is a classic cause of anaphylaxis. in addition, some substances (like iodinated contrast, opioid) may stimulate direct mast cell activation (non immunogenic process), leading to an anaphylaxis-like response that can be clinically indistinguishable from IgE-mediated anaphylaxis 

the primary disturbance in anaphylactic shock is profound peripheral vasodilation (distributic shock, as also seen with septic shock) which has the effects of: 

1. arteriolar vasodilation causes decreased dydtemic vascular resistance (SVR) and consequent hypotension 
2. Venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure (CVP) and reduces venous return to the right atrium 
3. the vasculature becomes leaky, resulting in loss of intravascular volume that further contributes to both hypotension and decreased CVP 

With reduced venous return to the right atrium, right ventricular output and blood delivery to the left atrium and left ventricle are reduced. this leads to decreased pulmonery capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), a reflection of left atrial pressure. despite the reduced left ventricular preload, cardiac output is commonly normal or increased in early distributive shock due to both the large decrease in SVR and a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate.

QID 17054

a 26 yo woman is brought thte emergency due to an episode of near-syncope. the patient's husband states that they were at a buffet 20 minutes ago, when she suddenly experienced severe weakness and dizziness. the patient almost fell, so he helped her sit. she also had nausea, abdominal cramping, and a generalized itching sensation but no chest pain or shortness of breath. the patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. she is menstruating, and her husband says that she usually has heavy periods. temperature is 36.7, BP is 80/50, pulse is 120 and resp is 20. on physical examination, the patient is ill-appearing with flushed skin and warm extremities. the lings are clear to auscultation, and cardiac examination is normal except for tachycardia. the abdomen is soft with mild diffuse tenderness and bowel sounds are normal. ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. in addition to IV fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management 

1. antistaphylococcal antibodies 
2. intramuscular epinephrine (c)
3. intravenous proton pump inhibitor 
4. supportive care only 
5. syndronized cardioversion 
6. type O, Rh-neg. RBC transfusion 

Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis 
1. skin/mucosa involvement (hives, lip or tongue swelling) and either hypotension or respitaroy distress 
2. involvement of more than 2 organ systems after exposure to a likely allergen 
	1. skin/ mucosa (like hives, lip/tongue swelling)
	2. respiratory (eg. wheezing, stridor, dyspnea)
	3. cardiovascular (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, syncope)
	4. gastrointestinal (eg, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea)
3. hypotension after exposure 

~ 

this patient with abdominal cramping, pruritis, flushing, and hypotension has anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition that can develop at any age. anaphylaxis is caused by sudden, massive degranulation of mast cells and basophils, usually due to an IgE-mediated, type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to an allergen. the trigger is often known, however, there may be no prior allergic history, either because it is the first anaphylactice episode or because prior episoders were unrecognized. 

a variety of presentations can fulfill the diagnostic criteria. in general, anaphylaxis is likely hen symptom onset is rapid and more than two organ systems are affected. the most commonly used diagnostic criterior involves skin/mucosa (flushing, pruritis) involvement, which occus in more than 90% of patients, with cardiovascular (hypotension) or respiratory (stridor, bronchospasm) manifestations. however, patient with exposure to an known allergen require only hypotension for diagnosis. 

managememnt required prompt administration of intramuscular epinephrine, which has alpha-1 and beta-2 agonist effects causing vasocontriction (increased blood pressure and decreased edema) and decreased release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils (decreased allergic reaction), respectively. repeat dosing may be required.

choice 1 - staphylococcal [[toxic shock syndrome]] can occur in menstruating women who use tampons, it may also cause hypotension, skin menifestations, and gastrointestinal symptoms. however, high fever is expected, onset is typically less abrupt, and the associated rash is typically diffuse and erythematous, involving the palms and soles. 

choices 3 and 6 (IV PPI and Rh antibodies) - intravenous proton pump inhibitors are indicated for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas type O, Rh-negative red blood cell transfusion (incross-matched blood) is indicated for severe, life-threatening bleeding. such patients develop hypovolemic shock characterized by cool, pale extremities (as opposed to this patient's warm, flushed extremities) typically with hematemesis or hematochezia. pruritis would be unexpected. 

choice 5 sychronized cardioversion - synchronized cardioversion is indicated in unstable arrhythmia (SVT w hypotension). however, this patient has sinus tachycardia, a compensatory mechanism in the setting of anaphylaxis-induced distributive shock that would not improve with cardioversion.
