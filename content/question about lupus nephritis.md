27 yo woman comes to the office for excessive fatigue, weight loss and achy pain in ther hands over the last 2 months, theses symptoms started after a recent caribbean cruise trip 

temp is 37.3, bp 156/92 and pulse is 86. bmi is 22. on examination, bilateral finger joints and wrists are mildly swollen and tender to palpation. a well-defined erythematous plaque with scale, pigment alteration and scarring is present over the left are. cardiopulmonary exam shows no abnormalities. the abdomen is soft and nontender. lab shows a serum creat of 1.5. urine is positive for 2+ protein and 1+ blood which of the following is most appropriate for guiding proper therapy for this patient? 

1. blood cultures 
2. cervical spine xray 
3. CT scan of the abdomen 
4. kidney biopsy (c)

---
this patient's elevated serum creat, hematuria, proteinuria and hypertension are consistent with glomerular injury. she also has evidence of multisystem involvement, including constitutional symptoms (fatigue, weight loss), inflammatory arthritis (swolle, tender joints), and skin lesions (erythematous plaque with scale, pigment change and scar) concerning for discoid lupus. these manifestations developed after a caribbea trip, suggesting photosensistivity (with sun exposure caisng DNA damage and inflammation). this presentation is highly concerning for SLE flare complicated by lupus nephritis. 

because easly diagnosis and treatment can reduce the morbidity and mortality of lupus nephritis, urgent kidney biopsy is indicated for any patient with known or suspected SLE who has evidence of kidney involvedment (abnormal proteinuria, active urine sediment, elevated serum creatinine). in addition to ruling out other SLE-related kidney diseases (thrombotic microangipathy), kidney biopsy establishes the diagnosis of lupus nephritis and defines the histologic class, which determines treatment. 

the histologic classification of lupus nephritis is related to the glomerular site (mesangial, subendothelial, subepithelial) of immune complex (IC) deposists formed by autoantibodies against nuclear self-antigens (like anti-double-stranded DNA bound to DNA). clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic proteinuria and or microscopic hematuia for mesangial ICs (class 1, 2) to glomerulonephritis for subendothelial IC (class 3 and 4). subepithelial IC (class 5) produce nephrotic syndrome. treatment is determiend by histologic class. class 6 lupus nephritis describes end-stage scarring >90% of glomeruli that is unlikely to benefit from the treatment.

QID 3898

28 yo woman comes to the emergency department due to perisstent bilateral headaches and fatigue 

the headaches started 4 weeks ago but they have gotten worse over the past 3 days and are not relieved with ibuprofen. the patient's other medical conditions include allergic rhinitis and an occasional sinus infection. she does not use recreational drugs. temp is 37.2 blood pressure is 170/110 pulse is 82HR and resps are 14. physical examination shows normal jugular venous pressure 

the lungs are clear and heart sounds are normal 

the abdomen is nontended and neurologic examination is normal there is 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities 

labs

which of the following is the most likely diagnosis 

1. granulomatosis with polyangitis 
2. hemolytic uremic syndrome 
3. hypertensive nephrosclerosis 
4. iga nephropathy 
5. lupus nephritis (c)
6. postretptococcal glomerulonephritis 

"this patient has glomerulonephritis (GN), characterized by hematuria (often with red cell casts), proteinuria, acute kidney injury (AKI), hypertension and edema. Serum complement levels can help differentiate the underlying GN mechanism. complement usually remains normal in antibody-mediated disorders (anti-glomerular basement membrane disease), whereas hypocomplementemia typically reflects consumption by circulating antigen-antibody complexes (ie, immune comple-mediated disease) with the rest of the clinical picture providing diagnostic clues

hypocomplementemic GN in this woman of childbearing age with pancytopenia and no antecedent or concurrent infection is suspicious of lupus nephritis. [[lupus nephritis]] is a common ma nifestation of SLE and may be the presenting feature. the spectrum of kidney abnormalities is related to the glomerular site of immune complex deposition (leg., subendothelial deposits in contact with the circulation cause complement activation and glomerular inflammation). Kidney biopsy compatible with lupus nephritis can confirm SLE in those with a suggestive clinical feature (eg., presense of anti-dsDNA ab)

[[lupus nephritis]]

although headaches prompted this patient's evaluable and may be assoc with things like hypertension from GN, they are not specific to SLE, and are often unrelated (tension-type), normal neurologic examination makes neurologic manifestations of SLE (like neurophyschiatric lupus) unlikely."

wrong answers--

granulomatosis with polyangitis -- mediated by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies -- can cause glomerulonephritis. although upper respiratory tract menifestions (rhinitis, sinusitis) are common, completement is usually normal because antibody mediated (i.e pauci-immune) disorder do not cause significant consumption 

hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, and AKI. however, the microvascular thrombi that cause hemolysis and platelet consumption do not consume leukocytosis (i.e. no leukopenia), and although hematuria is common, red cell casts are not typical 

hypertensive nephrosclerosis - can cause proteinuria and kidney dysfunction. however, it manifests with slowly progressive renal insufficiencey wafter longstanding hypertension, GN and pancytopenia is are not seen 

althought iga nephorpathy is an aimmune comples - mediated cause of glomerulonephtrits, serum m=completment is typically normal. lack of significant completment comnusption may result from the predominnatly loca (or mesangial) effects of IgA and its limitated activation of the classical pthway. 

postestreptococcal GN causes immune mediated GN with hypocomplementemia. however, it classically involves a recent (within weeks) throat or skin infeciton and pancytopenia is not expected.
