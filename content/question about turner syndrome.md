an 8 1/2 year old girl was diagnosed with turner syndrome a year ago and is on growth hormone treatment now. the mother brought the patient in as she is concerned that other than some pubic hair growth, no other signs of puberty are present. the mother demands an immediate start of estrogen treatment. an internet site she browsed mentioned that estrogen treatment stimulated the development of secondary sexual characteristics. 

which of the following could be caused by starting high-dose estrogen immediately? 

1. help in preservation of the remaining follicles in the ovaries 
2. be associated with development of theca lutein cysts in the ovary 
3. galactorrhea 
4. increase chances of developing endometriosis later 
5. lead to short stature in adulthood

~ Turner syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities affecting 1 in 2000 live-born infants. it is pan-ethnic and has no known risk factors. turner syndrome is basically due to the absence of a set of genes normally present on the short arm of the X chromosome. the most common cause is a complete absence of one of the X chromosomes (karyotype 45X), with the paternal one being th emissing one in 2/3rds of the case. turnser syndrome may also result from a normal karyotypes, the disorder develops at the time of conception or during the first few cell divisions. it can present at any time from birth to adult life. about 95% of those with turner syndrome have short stature and infertility. 

although estrogen might stimulate growth and contribute to the puberty growth spurt, it eventually leads to the closure of the epiphyseal plates. therefore, giving high estrogen doses too early compromises adult height
