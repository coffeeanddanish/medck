a 67 yo man comes to the offic due to 2 weeks of intermittent blood in the urine 

He has had no pain, urgency, dysuria, frequency, urethral discharge, or nocturia. the bleeding is present throughout micturation. the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. he has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. he is sexually active. temp is 36.9C, blood pressure is 120/80 and pulse is 78, resps are 16. abdomen is soft and nontender with no masses; bowel sounds are normal. rectal exam shows an enlarged prostate with no tenderness, asymmetry, or induration. urinalysis shows >50 red blood cells/hpf, there are no leukocytes, casts, or dysmorphic erythrocytes. urine cytology shows no abnormal cells. which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation of this patient? 

1. abdominal ultrasound 
2. cystoscopy (c)
3. prostate-specific antigen level 
4. reassurance and routine follow-up 
5. urine culture 

The most common malignancy of the urinary tract is bladder cancer. most cases occur due to malignant transformation of the epithelium of the urinary tract, urothelium, in response to chronic exposure to carcinogens such as (tobacco smoke or industrial chemicals). Tumor growth is associated with formation of new blood vessels that are _friable_ (as in easily crushed); bleeding in the urinary tract is common and painless and lasts throughout micturation. Please remember that tumors in the bladder neck may present with terminal hematuria (not throughout). 

More than 90% bladder cancers are urothelial carcinoma. Manifestations are painless hematuria throughout micturation, _irritative voiding symptoms_, regional pain. 

Diagnosis is by flexible cystaoscopy with biopsy - which is the gold standard - and urine cytology. But the question stem goes against some of these points! (but later it says urine cytology sensitivity is <35%)

Staging we can do 2 things: resection and imaging. TURBT - transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Upper urinary tract imaging (IVP, MRI, CT)

Workup: We begin with urinalysis (>3rbc/hpf) to rule out common things like UTI (bacterial, etc) and glomerulopathies (red blood cell casts, dysmorphic rbc). 

Patients who do not have a clear cause of this hematuria, and are above the age of 40, will require some kind of imaging like cystoscopy or CT urography - the prime objective is to rule out bladder ca. urine cytology is also part of the evaluation, it has a low sensitivity <35% as mentioned prev. but we still do it. 

wrong answers - later
