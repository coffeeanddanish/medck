Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (premenstrual syndrome or PMS) is a combination of physical, emotional, or behavioral symptoms that occur prior to the menstrual cycle and are absent during the rest of the cycle. The symptoms, on occasion, are severe enough to interfere significantly with work and/or home activities.

Given a patient with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMS), the candidate will assess the severity and complications, and will initiate an appropriate management plan. Specifically, the candidate will differentiate PMS from normal premenstrual symptoms or from other causes of physical and mood changes, and will explore the psychosocial impact of the condition.
