falx cerebri is one of the four folds of the [[dura mater]] ([[dural folds]]) that compartmentalize the internal cranial cavity into different regions. they are made of dense irregular connective tissue. falx cerebri is a strong, crescent-shaped septa or sheet that runs in the mid-sagittal plane. it occupies the longitudinal fissure between the two cerebral hemispheres. 

the falx cerebri is narrow anteriorly, where it attaches to a structure known as crista galli of the [[ethmoid]] bone, posteriorly it broadens and blends with the [[tentorium cerebelli]] and has an attachment to the internal occipital protuberance 

the superior sagittal sinus runs along the cranial groove (superior to the falx cerebri), and its lips merge with the falx cerebri. the lower surface of the falx cerebri is free and concave and houses the inferior sagittal sinus (the inferior sagittal sinus terminates into the straight sinus - which lies at the junctiion of falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli. (posteriorly, the sagittal sinus drains into the transverse sinus: this area is a confluence of sinus. Inferiorly, the occipital sinus also joins this confluence)
