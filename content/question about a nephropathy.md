62 yo man comes into the office due to malaise and fatigue for the past several weeks. 

he also experiences an episode of severe flank pain 3 mo ago that he attributed to muscle pain. the patient has a history of chronic back pain from a work-related injury 10 years ago for which he underwent surgery. he last saw a physician 2 years ago and medical history is otherwise not significant. his only medications are OTC analgesics. he does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. blood pressure is 134/86 and pulse is 80. physcial examination of the heart, lung and abdomen is normal. the prostate is mildly enlarged. there is no back deformity or tenderness and neurological examination is normal. lab results are as follows: 

Hb 10.4 
mcv 92 
bun 32 
creat. 2.2 
protein 2+ 
wbc 20-30 
rbc 1-2 
casts wbc and hyaline casts 

renal ultrasonogram reveals bilateral small kidneys. which of the following the most likely underlying cause of this patients renal dysfunction? 

1. chronic glomerulonephritis 
2. chronic pyelonephritis 
3. recurrent nephrolithiasis 
4. renal artery stenosis 
5. tubulointerstital nephritis (c)

----
the answer is talking about nephropathy induced by too many OTC pain meds. 

Pathophysiology of that is: that acetaminophen is a direct oxidative real toxic substance
and aspiringor NSAID inhibits the neutralization of this toxic metabolite, which cosequently injures the kidney / the organ of drug elmination 
*please remember here that - this manifestation of chronic pain meds is interstitial nephritis w/w/o papillary necrosis* 

how does it clinically present: 

1) hx of chronic pain such as headche / lower back pain 
2) often asymptomatic, may have malaise, fatigue, flank pain etc. 
3) urinalysis: WBC and WBC casts w/w/wo mild protenisu 
4) hematuria and urine tbc for pap necrosis 
5) imaging will show bilateral small kidney w/w/o pap. calcification 

"this patient's elecation SCr indicates kidney injury of unknown chronicity. in such patient's with an unknown baseline creatinine, renal U/S can help establish the chronicity, bilateral small kidney on ultrasonography suggest chronic kidney disease"

"presence of elevated urine wbc and wbc casts is indicative tubulointerstitial nephritis and this patient's analgesic use for chronic back pain raises suspicion for analgesic nephrompathy, a form of chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN). analgesis acetaminophen in combination with aspirin or another NSAID"

Metabolite --> acetominophen --> injury to tubes and excretory part of kidney ---> microscopic hematuria, casts of wbcs and hyaline --> clinically asymptomatic with constitutional sx NO fever
