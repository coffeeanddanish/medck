community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a very common diagnosis in th eoutpatient setting. it can be very diabling and is associated with considerable mortality in elderly patients and those with multiple co-morbidities. as such, it is important to be diagnosed upon presentation and treated accordingly 

CAP usually presents with cough productive of sputum, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. other common symptoms affect GI and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. there is an acute onset of symptoms. 

empiric therapy should begin as soon as possible after diagnosis. the most likely pathogens causing CAP are ***S.pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory viruses***. treatment with a five day course of azithromycin is one of th erecommended options. alternatively, clarithromycin or doxycycline are also acceptable 

inhaled albuterol, inhaled corticosteroids or a combination of both may be used in asthma and/or COPD exacerbations 
as the patient does not need admission to the hospital for treatment, there is no need for any IV medication (IV vancomycinoption)
