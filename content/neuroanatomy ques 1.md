Give an example of an extradural hematoma and how and why it causes injury 

A classic site of injury is a blow to the head that causes rupture of a high-pressure artery such as the middle meningeal artery, anywhere along its course. Separation of the dura from the periosteum requires significant force, such as a skull fracture followed by a arterial rupture, which will inevitably cause rapid collection of blood into the extradural space. 

This pool of blood, hematoma, is under significant force by the resistance of the strong adhesion between the dura and periosteum. As a ruptured artery feeds blood at a high rate, we can say that an extradural hematoma acts as a rapidly expanding intracranial mass and is a medical emergency which requires immediate diagnosis and treatment.
