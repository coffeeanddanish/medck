prctitis is a general inflammation of the anal tissue and the last part fo the rectum. its main symptoms consist of anal pain, including straining, rectal bleeding and cramping and spasming during defecation. it commonly produces tenesmus (causing frequent attempts to defecate, but not true diarrhea) and constipation. the diagnosis is usually made on colonoscopy and treatment consists of antibiotics. 

based on the history and physical exam, the most likely diagnosis is proctitis, which is an inflammation of the mucosa causing rectal discomfort. 

however, since the patinet's diagnosis is still uncertain, more invasice testing is needed. 

1. patients with severe tensmus or rectal pain are treated with sucralfate or glucocorticoid enemas. in this patient we first need to reach the gianosis 
3. we do not know the diagnosis at this time, so antibiotics and antivrals (4) would not be indicated 
5. an exploratory laparotomy is not necessary at this time
