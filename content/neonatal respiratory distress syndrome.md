taken directly from explanation 

neonatal respiratory distress (NRDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease, occurs almost exclusively in premature infants. the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) are related inversely to the gestational age of the newborn infant 

NRDS begins shortly after birth and is manifested by tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions, expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis during breathing efforts. the lungs of infants with rds are developmentally deficient in surfactant, which helps prevent the collapse of the terminal air spaces (the future site of alveolar development) throughout the normal cycle of inhalation and exhalation. chest radiographs of a newborn infant with respiratory distress syndrome reveal bilateral, diffuse, reticular granular or ground-glass appearances; air bronchograms; and poor lung expansion. the prominent air bronchograms represent aerated bronchioles superimposed on a background of collapsed alveoli.
