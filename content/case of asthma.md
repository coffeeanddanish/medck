a 10-year old child is brought to your dept by his concerned mother 

the child had cough, wheezing, SOB, and chest tightness 2 days ago and this is probably the 4th time over the last 3 months. he does not remember anything that could have triggered this two days ago, but he had been playing and running all day. he is breathing well today and denies wheezing, chest tightness, cough and fever.. past medical history is significant for bronchiolitis as an infant and an upper respiratory infections 4 months ago. he has no history of atopic eczema and seasonal allergies. 

40 week gestation with a birth wt of 3.7kg. he has been growing and developing normally. family history is unremarkable. the mother does not smoke, but the father smokes at thome. 

vital signs are temeperature 37.4, BP 110/65, HR 80, and resp 16. on physical examination, there is normal fremitus, the lungs are resonant to percussion, and no wheezing or crackles are herd on auscultaiton. on spirometry, the FEV1 is 80%. 

q1. You believe a methacholine challenge test should be done. generally speaking, which of the following statements correctly state what physicians should keep in mind when ordering this test? correct ans: 
1. ask the patient not to drink coffee on the day of the test 
2. ask the patient no to take nedocromil [[Drugs]] 48h before the test 
3. ask the patient not to use salmeterol 48h before the test 
4. ask the patient not to use tiotropium for one week before the test 
5. baseline spirometry always has to be done first 
6. if the patient had recent respiratory infection, you would advise waiting 6 weeks post-infection 
7. the max dose that can be given is 16 mg/mL

q2. Methacholine challenge with 4 milligrams per ml given to the child demonstrates 20 percent decrease in fev. after further evaluation and bronchodilator therapy when he is symptomatic, a dx of athma is made. which of the foll could indiacte asthma severity. correct ans

1. peak expiratory flow remaining low between two asthmatic attacks 
2. pulsus paradocus 
3. spirometry demonstrating airway obstruction with poor bronchodilator response 

q3. the child is given albuterol inhaler to be used on an as needed basis. six months later the child is brought to your department, with complaints that he has been having shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing, more frequently. he has trouble sleeping becaus eof his symptoms at night at least once a week. he has had to use albuterol at least four times a week. he is asymptomatic in the office. 

which one of the foll. would be the most appropriate next step in management 

1. give omeprazole to be taken every night before bed 
2. treatment with daily cromolyn [[Drugs]] sodium inhaler 
3. treatment with daily ipratropium inhaler 
4. treatment with daily fluticasone inhaler (c)
5. treatment with daily salmeterol inhaler 
6. treatment with daily theophylline 
7. treatment with monthly omalizumab 
8. treatment with oral methylprednisone (medrol) [[Drugs]] taper

detailed explanations 

q1. this child presents with complaints of what seems to have been exercise-induced asthma he had two days ago. he has experienced dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and other symptoms suggestive of asthma over the last three months. 

asthma is defined as a chronic but reversible airway inflammation characterized by periodic attacks of wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness and coughing. in asthmatic patients airways are hyper responsive to antigen or triggers which leads to acute obstructive symptoms by bronchoconstriction mucus plugs and increased inflammation. asthma cannot be diagnosed at first presentation it is called reactive airway disease until there are recurrent presentations 

when there is high likelihood of the diagnosis a trial of bronchodilator therapy can be started. family history past history of atopic eczema seasonal allergies and frequency of symptoms indicate a high probability of asthma. where there is an intermediate probability, the diagnosis is uncertain, and further assessment should be done. methacholine challenge is a bronchoprovocation testing that is useful when spirometry findings are normal or near normal, especially in patient swith intermittent or exercise-induced asthma symptoms. its positive predictive value is not high. therefore it cannot confirm asthma but its negative predictive value is very high and a negative test should steer a clinican to consider another diagnosis.

baseline spirometry should be done in all patients who are to undergo a methacholine challenge test. spirometry is done in patients who are 5 years and older. the national asthma expert panel considers the methacholine challenge test contraindicated in patient with FEV1 less than 60 per cent of predicted. certain factors change bronchial responsiveness and can compromise methacholine challenge test. therefore they should be avoided. these include coffee on the same day, nedocromil, and salmeterol taken 48 hours befor the test, tiotropium taken seven days before testing and a recent upper respiratory infection up to 6 weeks. methacholine is administered in incremental doses up to maximum dose of 16 milligrams per ml and a 20 per cent increase in fev1 up to the 4 mg per ml level is considered a positive test result for the presence of bronchial hyper responsiveness

q2. the red flags of asthma severity includes fatigue, cyanosis, silent chest, diminished expiratory effort and diminished level of consciousness. other signs of respiratory distress are nasal flaring, tracheal tugging, accessory muscle use, intercostal indrawing, pulsus paradoxus, and difficulty speaking or coughing 

q3. the child's asthma is poorly controlled. signs of poorly controlled asthma are : use of beta-2-agonist more than 4 times a week, asthma related school absence, exercise-induced asthma, and night time symptoms occuring more than once a week. treatment goals are to have symptoms less than 4 times a week with normal physical activity, no night time symptoms and fev1 more than 90 per cent. 

since albuterol a short acting beta agonist is insufficient to meet these goals in this child, maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids should be started. inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone are the most effectove maintenence drugs in children and adults. since in the majority of children, asthma can be controlled with low doses of corticosteroids, 200 micrograms per day should be an initial dose (inhaled). in canada doses greater than 400 are not approved for children. growth failure and adrenal suppression.
