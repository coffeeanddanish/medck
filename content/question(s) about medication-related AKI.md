65 yo man comes to the emergency due to fever, chills and a productive cough for the past 3 days 

he also has shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain, that is worse with deep breathing. other medical conditions include low-dose aspirin, atorvastatin, metformin and sitagliptin. the patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. temp is 37, blood pressure is 95/60, pulse is 112, resps are 24. o2 sat is 96 and examination shows dry mucous membranse. labs:

chest xray reveals in infiltrate in the right lower lobe. blood cultures are obtained and intravenous fluids and antibiotics are administered. which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient? 

1. discontinue aspirin 
2. discontinue atorvastatin 
3. discontinue metformin (c)
4. start IV insulin infusion 
5. start lisinopril 
6. start zoledronic acid 

this patient has sepsis likely due to community acq. penumonia. lab results show an elevated creat that likely represents aki in the setting of dehydration (dry mucous membrane, bun:creat ratio>20) and sepsis. metformin is highly useful in the outpatient management of type 2 dm, but it increases the formation of lactic acid and may cause dangerous lactic acidosis in clinical settings that facilitate lactic acid accumulation 

because metformin is renally cleared, one of the major concerms with its use is renal insufficiency. metform shound be temporarily held in the setting of AKI and should not be given in patients with ckd and an estimated gfr of less than 30. other clinical concerns with metformin use include hepatic insufficiency (the liver metabolizes lactic acid) and decompensated heart failure (which impairs renal perfusion). Sepsis and dehydration increases lactic acid levels and are additional reasons to hold metformin in this patient. 

because of a number of clinical settings that create concern with metformin, the drug is often precautionarily held in hospitalized patients, regardless of renal funciton 

----
metformin 

mechanism of action 
inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase 
upregulates AMP-activated protein kiase 

metabolic effects 
decreases hepatic glucose production 
decreases intestinal glucose absorption 
increases peripheral glucose uptake or utilization 
decreases lipogenesis 

pharmacokinetics 
renal clearance 
no significant metabolites 

adverse effects 
diarrhea 
lactic acidosis 
b12 deficiency 

contraindications 
renal insufficiency 
hepatic insufficiency 
decomp. heart failure

wrong answers: 

1) stop aspiring: although aspirin is a NSAID, low-dose aspirin does not significantly affect renal blood flow and does not need to be help in patients with AKI. in this patient with coronary artery disease, the benegits of continuing low-dose aspiring outweight the risks 
2) stop statins" most statins undergo clearance via the gi and not significantly cleared by kindley, so they dont need to be discontinued in pts with aki 
3) IV insulin: is indicated for patients with severe hyperglycemia
4) ACEi initiate - will temporarily reduce the gfr due to dilation of renal efferent arteriole and should not be initiated in the setting of AKI 
5) zoledronic acid / bisphosphonate therapy - unrequried

QID 4034

70 yo woman is brought to the emergency by her daughter due to lethargy 

the patient has a history of mild cognitive impairment but lives alone and able to perform daily activities by hyerself. she experienced a minor febrile illness iwth URT symptoms several days ago and her primary care physician advised symptomatic treatment. since then, the patient has reported generalized weakness and decreased appetitie to the daughter. today, the patient did not answer her phone and the daughter found her lethargic and confused. the patient takes no medications and does not use tobacco or alcohol. temp is 37.2, blood pressure is 92/50, pulse is 110, repss are 18. physical examination shows dry oral mucosa and lung ausc reveals right-sided bronchial breath sounds and crackles.

chest radiogrpahy reveal a right lower lobe consolidation. which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient 

urine sodium ( mEq/L) - urine sediment - urine wbc/hpf

1. <20 - none - 0-1 
2. <20 - brown granular casts - 5-10 
3. >20 - brown granular casts - 5-10
4. >20 - rbc casts - -0-1 
5. >70 - rbc cast - 5-10 

"this patient's clincial presentation (altered mental status, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis eviden of r lower lobe consolidation on xchet xray) is consistence with **sepsis due to community acquired pneumonia** sepsis leads to peripheral vasodilation (hypotension) and intravascular volume depletion (due to vascular leakage); menifestations of volume depretion in this patient include decreased appetite or poor intake, dyr mucous membranes and hypernatremia. the combined effects of sepsis and volume depletion suggest that this patient has a prerenal acute kidney injury due to decreased renal perfusion"

**renal hypoperfusion** : what does it do? it will lead to a decrease in gfr and incr. scr. activation of raas results in increased sodium reabsorption by th ekidneys -- this will give you a urinary sodium below 20 and fena <1%. 

urea passively follows the reabsorption of the sodium and water, resulting in an elevated bun:creat of more than >20:1. -- this is no intrinsic kidney damage or infection in pure prerenal AKI - therefore - bland urinary sediment 

{in addition to the treatment of the underlying disorder eg., antibiotics for pneumonia, patients with prerenal AKI require volume resuscitation with IV crystalloids asap}
