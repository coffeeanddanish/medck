a 60 yo woman with a history of poorly controlled type 2 DM comes to the emergency due to worsening perianal pain 

the patient is febrile, hypotensive and tachycardic. P/E reveals tenderness and swelling in the perianal and gluteal region with dusky overlying skin and palpable crepitus. Leukocytes count is 27 and CT scan shows edema of the gluteal and perineal subcutaneous tissue with free gas. 

IV fluids and antibiotics are initiated. and the patient undergoes urgent surgical debridement of teh necrotic tissue. 

several hours later, she experiences increasing dyspnea and hypoxemia. CXR reveals new bilateral lung infiltrates. bedside echocardiography shows a hyperdynamic left ventricle with no significant valve disease. which of the follwoing best describes this patinet's current pulmonary condition ?

0. Hypoxemia correction with moderate-flow oxygen - Lung compliance - A-a gradient 
1. yes - low - high 
2. yeas - low - normal 
3. yes - high - high 
4. no - low - high (c)
5. no - normal - high

causes of hypoxemia 

reduced PiO2 (partial pressure of inspired oxygen) = 
examples: high altitude; 
the A-a gradient of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is normal, 
is there correction with supplemental oxygen? yes. but what does it mean really? 

hypoventilation = example: CNS depression or morbid obesity
normal A-a gradient 
correction with supplemental oxygen = yes 

Diffusion limitation = example: emphysema or ILD 
A-a gradient is increased and O2 correction is possible 

V/Q or ventilation perfusion ratio mismatch 
you may find it in a small PE or lobar pneumonia 
A-a gradient = increased and correction = yes 

large intrapulmonary shunt 
diffuse pulmonary edema 
increased 
no 

large dead space ventilation 
massive PE 
right to left cardiac shunt 
increased 
no 

This patient with hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates likely has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis from necro fasciitis. ARDS involves an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leakage and diffuse pulmonary edema. 

Fluid from pulmonary edema fills the alveoli and faciliates alveolar collapse. alveolar ventilation (V) is zero, which results in an extreme V/Q mismatch (right to left intrapulmonary shunting) (?) causing hypoxemia. Because diffuse pulmonary edema prevents air from reaching the alveoli throughout much of the lungs, an increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) does not correct the hypoxemia 

Increased A-a gradient is another characteristic of pulmonary edema, as with any process causing V/Q mismatch or impaired diffusion across the A-a membrane. Finally, pulmonary edema also leads to fluid correction within the lung interstitium, resulting in stiffening of the lungs (decreased lung compliance)

in contrast to hypoxemia, due to diffuse pulmonary edema, hypoxemia due to localized intrapulmonary shunting (like lobar pneumonia, atelectasis, basilar pulmonary edema) typically does not correct with increased FiO2 because only a portion of the lungs is affected and the normally ventillated alveoli compensate via increased oxygen transfer 



Pulmonary edema causes hypoxemia due to right to left intrapulmonary shunting, an extreme ventilation / perfusion mismatch. when the edema is diffuse, alveolar ventilation is zero throughout much of the lungs and the hypoxemia does not correct with supp oxygen. as with any type of v/q mismatch, pulmonary edema leads to an increase in A-a gradient. it also causes stiffening of the lungs and decreased lung compliance.
