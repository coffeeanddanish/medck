aortic stenosis 

signs and symptoms 
exertional angina, dyspnea, syncope, orthopnea, exertional dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, presyncope, peripheral edema, heart failure symptoms, decreased exercise tolerance 

physical findings 
narrow pulse pressure, brachial-radial delay, pulsus parvus et tardus, sustained PMI;
ausculation 
crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur radiating to the right clavicle and carotid, musical quality at the apex known as gallavardin phenomenon

further investigations? 
ECG: what are you looking for? 
LVH and strain, LBBB, left atrial enlargement (LAE), AFib 
Echocardiography 
you want to know the valve area, the morphology, identify the etiology, prognosis, hemodynamics, systolic function 
other special tests? 
low-dose dobutamine stress testing 
CT imaging / aortic valve calcium score 
exercise testing (unless symptomatic)

treatment options are: 

for a calcific aortic stenosed valve - statins are given in accordance with the standard atherosclerotic risk score 
if there is severe aortic stenosis: be mindful to avoid nitrates, arterial dilators and ACEi (for severe cases)
why? don't know

surgival aortic valve repair = SAVR
transcatheteric valve repair = TAVR

SAVR 
man has to be less than 65 years of age with more than 20 year life expectancy and transcatheteric aortic valve repair is contraindicated for what ever reason 

("conduct prior to pregnancy" not sure what this statement means, C57)

TAVR 
more than 80 years old and a life expectancy less than 10 years 

percutaneous aortic balloon dilatation

what is aortic stenosis 

aortic stenosis is a, to pictorally represent, a crescendo-decrescendo early systolic murmur. it occurs in congenital bicuspid (or even unicuspid) valve, with wear tear related calcification and in rheumatic disease. 

there are 4 stages, labelled A through D, where D is the only one with symptoms, and A-C are labelled "aysmptomatic". Let us discuss a typical person with aortic stenosis. Ao. stenosis would present as a man with breathing problems: exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He may have a low tolerance to exercise, and when he does, he may have pain, known as 'exertional angina'. Now, he may also have 2 things that start with a 'p' or have 'p' in it. that is syncope (+presyncope = which is the feeling of fainting) and peripheral edema. Peripheral edema is symptom of heart failure' the text does say that symptoms of aortic stenosis include heart failure symptoms. 

what is the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis? well, the stenosis creates and outflow obstruction. now this obstruction causes an increased the remaining diastolic volume or EDV. the result is hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with the addition of the word 'concentirc' which I don't know why its there. I mean, just saying hypertrophy would have been okay I think. internal accumulation of pressure due to stenosis may also extend to the atrium with a probability of LAE or left atrial enlargement...
