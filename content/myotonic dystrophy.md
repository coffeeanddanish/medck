pathogenesis 
autosomal dominant CTG (cytosine-thymine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansion 
longer repeat length correlating with earlier and more severe disease 

presentation 
classic (adult) - myotonia and weakness (like face, hands and ankles)
childhood: cognitive and behavioral difficulties (classic symptoms develop over time) 
infantile-hypotonia, respiratory failure, inverted V-shaped upper lip 

associated findings 
cardiac - arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy 
gastrointestinal - dysphagia, constipation 
respiratory - pharyngeal weakness, hypoventilation 
nonmuscular - insulin resistance, hypogonadism, cataracts, frontal balding, excessive daytime sleepiness 

diagnosis and treatment 
genetic testing 
supportive
