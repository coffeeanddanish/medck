58 yo woman comes to the office due to increasing fatigue and muscle cramps over the past 2 months. 

shse has a 5 year old history of sjogren syndrome and reports dryness of her eyes and nout but no other symptoms. blood pressure is 130/74, pulse is 86HR. physical examintion shows enlarge parotid glands and dry oral mucosa. lab" 

sodium 139 
k 3.1 
cl 116
bicarb 1.3 
creatinine 1.1 

abg 
ph 7.32

urine pH 6.8 

which of the following is the most liekly cause of this patient's acid-base imbalance> 

1. impaired respiratory muscle function 
2. impaired urinary excretion (c)
3. increased GI bicarb losee 
4. increased ketoacid production 
5. increased lact acid produciton 
6. intracellular shift of bicarb 

-----
this patient has primary metabolic acidosis, evidenced by pH <7.35 and bicardobate of <24. the normal anion gap of 10 is consistent with nonaniongap metabolic acidosis - which results from loss of bicarbonate. this patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to type 1 renal rubular acidosis - which is a common of complication sjogren's 

there are 3 major types of renal tubular acidosis  - all of which cause non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to net loss of bicarbonate 

Type 1: Distal = results from impaired hydrogen ion sectretion by alpha-intercalated cells in the distal tubule. 

when this happens - hypokalemia is typically present due to reduction of potassium reabsorption - and urine ph is over 5.5 - this is expected due to markeldy impaired capacity to acidify the urine 

Type 2: (proximal) RTA results from impaired bicarbonated absorption with hypokalemia, because dital tubule could compensate for the bicarb loss, urine ph is <5.5 

Tyoe 4 RTA - results from the reduced aldosterone activity, leading to impaired H and K secretion in the collecting duct. in contrast to type 1 and 2, _hyperkalemia_ is typical. the urine pH is usually leass than 5.5 

[[metabolic acidosis]]

Normal anion gap 

Mechanism: loss of bicarb 

etiologies: 

severe diarrhea, RTA, excess saline infusion, intestinal or pancreatic fistula, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) and mineralocorticoid recptor antagonist (spironolactone)

elevated anion gap 

mechanism: accumulation of unmeasured acidic compounds 

etiologies: 
lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, kidney failure (uremia), methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylate toxicity
