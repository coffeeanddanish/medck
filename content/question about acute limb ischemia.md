58 year old man comes to the ed due to sudden onset of severe right leg pain several hours ago; the leg has since become numb.

he has never has similar symptoms and has no history of trauma, fever or chills. the patient recently has an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction that resulted in cardiogenic shock; he is undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. 

temp is 36.7C, 120/70 mm HG, RR 90 and regular, resp is 16. 

cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. compared w/ the left leg, the right leg appeals pale and cool to the touch. in the right lower extremity, the popliteal pulse is normal, but more distal pulses are **not** palpable. 

pulses in the other extremities are normal. neuro exam shows loss of sensation over the dorsum of the right foot and mild weakness with dorsiflexion. 

which is the most likely cause? 

1. arterial embolism 
2. arterial thrombosis 
3. arterial vasculitis 
4. cerebral ischemia 
5. nerve compression 
6. venous thrombosis 

This patient with sudden onset of severe right leg pain and signs of arterial occlusion (like coolness, numbness, pulselessness, weakness) has acute limb ischemia or ALI. ALI can be caused by either: embolism of a cardiac or intraarterial thrombus; local thrombosis from disruption of a preexisting atherosclerotic plaque ( like from [[peripheral arterial disease]] or PAD); or a trauamatic vessel disruption or dissection (penetrating or blunt trauma)

the sudden devpt. of ALI in this previously asymptomatic patient without PAD (bc normal pulses in unaffected extremities) or vascular trauma is most consistent with embolic occlusion 

most arterial emboli originate from the heart. potential cardiac sources include left atrial thrombus (like AFib), left ventricular thrombus ([[left ventricular aneurysm]]), infective endocarditis (or septic emboli) and prosthetic valve thrombosis/ given this patient's recent severe anterior myocardial infarction which caused cardiogenic shock, formation of a left ventricular aneurysm is the most likely cause. when the infarted muscle failrs to contract during systole, ___stasis of adjacent blood can form an LV thrombus capable of susbsequent embolization___. 

! 

etiology
cardiac/arterial embolus (like AFib, LV thrombus, IE)
arterial thrombosis (PAD)
blunt trauma 

clinical features (6 P's)
pain 
pallor 
paresthesia 
pulselessness 
poiliothermia (cool extremity)
paralysis (late stage)

management 
anticoagulation (heparin)
thrombolysis vs surgery

why would it not be: 

arterial thrombosis - it usually develops from disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque in patients with preexisting PAD. this patient has no prior symptoms (claudication) or clinical signs (siminished pulses in unaffected extremities) of PAD 

arterial vasculitis - inflammation from arterial vasculitis (like takayasu, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis) may cause arterial thrombosis, progressive luminal occlusion, or aneurysm (with subsequent thromboembolism) that leads to ALI. However, constitutionsal symptoms (like fever, malaise, weight loss) are typically present, as well as other systemic findings specific to each vasculatic syndrome

venous thrombosis - deep vein thrombosis canc ause lower extremity pain. however, the pain is typically dull and aching (rather than severe and sudden) and swelling is typically present. in addition, pulselessness is more consistent with arteral inflow rather than a venou outflow occlusion.
