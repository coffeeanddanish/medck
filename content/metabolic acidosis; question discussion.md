60 yo man is brought to emergency due to fever, chills and confusion. 

the patient was fishing in the ocean yesterday and cut his foot on a jagged rock which wading through shallow water. he was unable to clean the would right away, and overnight, it became increasingly red and painful. the patient was awakened several times by fever and chills, and this morning, his wife found him disoriented. medical history includes hypertension. temperature is 38.8, blood pressure is 86/62, pulse is 118 and resps are 24. on physical examination, the patient is in moderate distress, heart sounds are rapid and regular with no murmurs. the lungs are clear to auscultation. breathing fast and shallow. the right foot shows a laceration with purulent drainage and erythema spreading to the midshin. abg shows: 

pH 7.08
paO2 86 (75-105)
PaCO2 42 (33-45)
HCO3 12 (22-28)

what is the acid-base status? 

1. compensated metabolic acidosis 
2. compensated respiratory acidosis 
3. mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis (c)
4. mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis 
5. mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis 

a mixed acid-base disorder involves more than 2 primary disturbances and may be suggested by either a abnormal pH or a near-normal pH despite significant abnormalities in bicarbonate and CO2. 

here is a step-wise approach of evaluation of acid-base status 

1. evaluate the pH (normal 7.4): this patinet's low pH of 7.08 indicates acidemia 
2. identify the primary processL analyze the metabolic component of acid-base balance, bicarbonate and paCO2. the parameter shifted in the direction that explains the change in pH represents the primary disturbance. this patient's serum HCO3 - is significantly low (shifted toward scidity), indicating metabolic acidosis 
3. determine the compensation: primary metabolic disturbances are quickly compensated via adjustments in alveolar ventilation and CO2 removal. The expected eompensation for this patient's metabolic acidosis is respiratory alkalosis with a PaCO2 of approximately 26mmHg (Winter's formula). However, this patient's PaCO2 of 42mmHg is much higher than expected (inappropriate compensation). Indicating respiratory acidosis as a second primary disturbance. 

"the clinical presentation should then be examined ot ensure that a;; primary disturbances are explained. this patient has sepsis due to lower extremity cellulitis (fever, hemodynamic instability) wich explains primary metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis. the marked acidemia caused by severe sepsis creates high ventilatory demand that a patient may be unable to meet. this patinet's rapid, shallow breathing suggests respiratory muscle fatigue and hypoventilation, which constitues respiratory failure and account for primary respiratory acidosis. in addition to antibiotics and intravenous fluids for sepsis, such patients often require intubation and mechanical ventilation"
