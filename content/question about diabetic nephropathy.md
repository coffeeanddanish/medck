61 yo man comes to the office for evaluation of urinary symptoms. 

review of systems is positive for nocturnal urinary frequency, occasional dribbling, and a weak urinary stream for the past 3 months. the patient was diagnosed with type 2 DM 16 years ago. other medical conditions include hypertension, MI 2 years ago, and moderately decreased visual acuity. blood pressure is 160/100 pulse is 60, examination shows a left sided carotid bruit and traces bilateral ankle edema. post void bladder residual volume is 40mL. dipstick urinalysis reveals 2+ proteins and no blood. creat is 2.1. HbA1c is 7.3%. which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic kidney disease? 

1. microangiopathy (c)
2. minimal change nephropathy 
3. neurogenic bladder 
4. obstructive uropathy 
5. renal papillary necrosis 

This patient's age, nocturia, dribbling, and weak urinary stream initially suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia. however, lab evaluation shows proteinuria and elevated creatinine, which are unexpected with BPH alone. given his long-standing diabetes, these findings make ***diabetic kidney disease*** the most likely cause. 

DKD is a microvascular process (microangiopathy) that predominantly affects glomeruli. it is commonly asymptomatic in early stages but found on routine studies. this patients' risk factors include: 

- long-standing diabetes mellitus (>5-10 years)
- evidence of another microvascular disease (eg., retinopathy suggested by decreased visual acuity)
- poor glycemic control (A1c >7%, higher levels recommended only for patients who are eldergly or have increased risk for hypoglycemia)
- poorly controlled hypertension (>130/80)

Proteinuria (reflecting glomerular damage) particularly if persistent, is an important clue for diagnosis. although a positive urine dipstick test revealed this patient's proteinuria, the preferred screening test is random urine albumin/cratinine ratio, which detects excess albuminuria earlier. proteinuria is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and concurrent macrovascular disease (cardiovascular disease), like that in this patient (carotid bruit, MI) 

Minimal change nephropathy: minial change diseases causes nephrotic syndrome (proteinuri of more than 3.5, edema and hyperlipidemia) due to podocyte damage. however 2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick is unlikely to represent nephrotic-range proteinuria. MCD is more common in children. Although nephrotic syndrome can occur in diabetes, it usually involves glomerular (eg., glomerulosclerosis) rather than podocyte damage 

Neurogenic bladder: it can cause urinary symptoms but typically results from spinal cord injury or MS, is often accompanie by bladder spasms, and would not cause elevated creatinine or proteinuria. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can affect the bladder but causes overflow incontinence (continuous dribbling) with high postvoid residuals, this would not explain proteinuria or elevated creatinine. 

Obstructive uropathy: BPH explains this patient's urinary symptoms and increases the risk for obstructive uropathy (ie urinary outflow tract obstruction), but posvoid residual <50mL is inconsistent with significant obstruction. in addition, BPH is not associated with proteinuria and does not cause elevate creatinine unless complete obstruction occurs 

Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of sickle cell nephropathy, analgesic use, and diabetes mellitus. it typically causes flank pain and hematuria.
