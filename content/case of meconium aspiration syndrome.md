a 120 (?) hour old male neonate has been hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit since the first day of life for treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome. he schedules for discharge today, but his mother complaints of poor feeding and irritability for the last three hours. he was born at full term by normal deliver, his birth weight was 3.5kg. he recieved expressed breast milk via NG tube during the initial 48 hours of the birth and breastfeeding was started on the third day of his life. on the fourth day of life, he was breastfed very well. his temperature is 36.7C pulse 180min, and resp 50min but irregular. there is no cyanosis, jaundice, or hepatosplenomegaly. his physical exam does not suggest any congenital malformation. ausculatation over his lungs does not reveal the decreased intesity of breath sounds, crepitations, wheeze, or rhonchi. ausculation over his precordium does not reveal any abnormality except for the presence of tachycardia. 

q1. what are the possible diagnoses? 

correct answers: 

hypoglycemia 
intracranial hemorrhage 
neonatal sepsis

Detailed neuorlogic examination suggests that the neonate is irritable. there is an absence of seizures, rigidity, spasticity, hypotonia, focal cerebral signs, cranial nerve signs, or nuchal rigidity. the anterior fontanelee is full and both pupils are normal in size and are reactive to light normally. his blood glucose level as measured by a bedside glucose reagent strip is 80 mg/dL. which of the following investigations are indicated? 

blood culture 
cerebrospinal fluid cell count 
cerebrospinal fluic levels of protein and glucose level 
cerebrospinal fluid culture 
complete blood count with differential count 
serum c-reactive protein level 
serum procalcitonin level 
urine culture 


during treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome, the neonate has not received any antibiotic therapy or mechanical ventilation. bacterial isolates commonly detencted in the NICU and the community are sensitive to all the antibiotics given in the options. until lab reports are available, the initial empiric antibiotic therapy of the neonate must include combination of which of the following antibiotics? 

gentamicin 
vancomycin 

answer to question 1. 

neonates frequently present with non-specific clinical features such as poor feeding and irritability and it is important to diagnose and treat the uderlying etiology. neonatal sepsis is an important differential diagnosis. neonatal sepsis is a systemic bacterial, viral or fungal infection that can be potentially fatal. based on the timting of the presentation, it is classified into early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis. early-onset sepsis is characterized by an infection acquired by vertical acquisition of the pathogen from mother to neonate and usually presents before 72 hours of life. late-onset sepsis is characterized by an infection acquired from the environment and usually presents after 72 hours of life. late-onset sepsis is characterizd by an infection acquired from the environment and usually presents after 72 hours of life. however, delayed presentation of an infection caused by vertically acquired maternal pathogen can also be seen after 72 hours of life. 

because of highly variable clinical presentations, it is important to keep a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. the neonate has developed features such as poor feeding, tachycardia and irregular respiration on the fifth day of life after having been treated for meconium aspiration syndrome in NICU. hypoglycemia and neonatal sepsis can present with these clinical features. an early intracranial hemorrhage cn also present with poor feeding, irritability, tachycardia, and irregular respiration. 

q2 

neurologic examination of the neonate does not reveal any specific findings except for irritabliity and full anterior fontanelle. bedside blood glucose level measurememnt rules out hypoglycemia. because of history of hospitalization, late-onset sepsis with meningitis is the most likely diagnosis. for any neonate with suspected sepsis, it is important to obtain samples for blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urine culture before initiating empirical antibiotic therapy.

lumbar puncture is indicated in all neonates with suspected sepsis and or meningitis for cerebrospinal fluid cell count an dcerebrospinal fluid levels of protein and glucose. complete blood count with differential count and serum levels of acute phase reactants such as crp and prolactinonin are indicated in the initial evaluation of neonates with suspected sepsis.

q3 

it is important to initiate an empiric antimicrobial therapy in neonates with suspected sepsis before results of the lab investigations, include cultures, are available. the choice of empirical antibiotics should be guided by history and clinical examination findings and known antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacterial isolates commonly detected in the NICU as well as in the community. 

an appropriate initial empirical antibiotic therapy of late-onset sepsis is a combination of vancomycin and an amioglycoside such as gentamicin. some authors consider the administration of cefotaxime in addition to or instead of gentamicin in the treatment of neonatal meningitis. however, in general, an aminoglycoside-based regimen is preferred over cephalosporin-based regimen to reduce the risk of resistance.
