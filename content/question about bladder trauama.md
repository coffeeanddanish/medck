40 yo man is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. 

blood pressure is 130/84, pulse is 102. heart and lung sounds are normal. abdominal palpation shows fullness and tenderness in the suprapubic region. there is no blood at the urethral meatus, and digital rectal examination reveals a normal prostate. chest xray is normal. FAST reveals no intraperitoneal free fluid. pelvic x-ray reveals fracture of the left pubic ramus. a foley catheter is placed without resistance, with immediate return of bloody urine. emergency CT of the abdomen and pelvis is performed. which of the following injuries is most likely to be seen on CT scan? 

1. anterior bladder wall rupture 
2. bladder dome rupture 
3. left ureteral injury 
4. renal laceration 
5. urethral injury

So we know few things: 

there is fullness and tenderness on palpation of the suprapubic region
Echo FAST shows no fluid: what does that mean - that there has been no extravasation of urine 
pelvic x ray shows a fracture 

what are the basic signs/symptoms of bladder injury? 1) suprapubic tenderness 2) gross hematuria 3) difficulty voiding 

When an anterior bladder wall is rupture, the urine is contained within, but the intraperitoneal bladder "dome" rupture spills urine into the retroperitoneal space. This harkens intimate knowledge of the pelvic anatomy of the male/female body. 

Leakage of fluid into the peritoneal space may cause distention. The consequence can be urinary ascites or chemical peritonitis. 

confirmation of diagnosis is by retrograde cystography (bladder is passively filled via Foley catheter with water-soluble contrast and imaged - like CT scan or fluoroscopy).
