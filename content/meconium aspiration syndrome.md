pathophysiology 
meconium is sterile. but aspiration can cause chemical irritation causing chemical pneumonitis. it causes airway ofbstruction and also inactivation fo the surfactant. 

the risk factors or late-term delivery and meconium-stained amniocentesis 

the gestational age is term or late-term

clinical features are 
respiratory distress within the first few hours of life
barrel chest with audible crackle 
chemical pneumonitis
small airway obstruction 
tachypnea 

chest xray findings 
hyperinflation
patchy and coarse inflitrates 
patchy atelectasis 
10-20% have pneumothorax

prevention 
if baby is depressed, intubate and suction below the vocal cords 

treatment 
resuscitation 
oxygentaion 
extracorporeal membrane oxygen for PPHN (presistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn)
ventilatory support 
surfactant 
inhaled nitric oxide 

compilcations 
hypoxemia, hypercapnia, acidosis 
pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum 
chemical pneumonitis 
PPHN 
secondary surfactant inhibition 
respiratory failure 

prognosis 
dependant on severity 
mortality up to 20%
