the diaaphragma sellae is the smallest of the dura mater folds. it is circular in shape, transversely oriented and forms the roof of the sella turcica which houses the pituitary gland . it is pierced by the infundibulum (pituatry stalk). it forms the central opening which connects the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. 

it is bound posteriorly by the dorsum sellae and antriorly by the tuberculum sellae. laterally, are the middle clinoid process (of the [[sphenoid]])

On each sdie, the diaphragma sellae is continuous with the root of the cavernous sinus 

they also contain the posterior and anterior intercavernous sinus 

surgery

outdated pituitary surgery was landmarked by diaphragma sellae as it was accessed via a subfrontal approach by way of craniotomy. 

any degree of suprasellar extension was an indication of this surgery, and thus marked diaphragma sellae as an important structure. 

modern method is to approach via transsphenoidal approach.
