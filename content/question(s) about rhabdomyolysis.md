60 yo man is hospitalized with multiple generalized toni-clonic seizures 

the patient is a heavy alcohol user and has had previous hospitalizations for alcohol withdrawal and alcohol-related seizures. on the second day of hospitalization, temp 37.1C, blood pressure is 155/92, 108 HR, resps are 14. Examination shows no abnormalities 

labs 

Na 140 
K 5.6 
bicarb 20 
BUN 36 
creatinine 2.4 

urinalysis 
glucose negative 
ketones trace 
leukocyte esterase negative 
blood 2+ 

Urine microscopy shows white blood cells 2-5/hpf, red blood cells 0-1/hpf, and some epithelial cells. which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's renal dysfunction? 

1. acute interstitial nephritis 
2. glomerulonephritis 
3. hepatorenal syndrome 
4. nephrolithiasis 
5. renal artery stenosis 
6. rhabdomyolysis (c)
7. urinary tract obstruction 

what is rhabdomyolysis - it is a large-scale skeletal muscle necrosis - that can result from crush injury, ischemia, toxicity - (in case of seizure: overexertion and prolonged **muscle contraction**)

"a key component of rhabdomyolysis is the release of myoglobin, a skeletal muscle oxygen storage protein that contains heme pigment, into the bloodstream. in the kidneys, myoglobin is degraded and releases heme into the renal tubules, this can cause renal tubular obstruction and tubular epithelial cell injury, resulting ATN (renal insufficiency)

potassium and phosphorous are also released from lysed muscle cells, causeing hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia"

discrepancy btw urinalysis and urine microscopy is useful in recognizing rhabdomyolysis, how i don't know. = the blood component of urinalysis detects heme rather than actual RBC. therefore, myoglobinuria due to rhabdomyolysis leads to positive blood on urine microscopy; by contrast, true hematuria leads to positive blood on urinalysis and presence of RBC on urine microscopy.

[[rhabdomyolysis]]

etiology 
skeletal myscle lysis/necrosis due to 
crush injury or prolonged immobilization 
intense muscle activity (seizure or exertion)
drug or medication toxicitiy like statins 

C/F 
muscle pain and weakness 
dark urine (myoglobinuria/pigmenturia)
+blood on urinalysis but no rbc on microscopy 
inc. potassium, phosphorous, low calcium, ast more than alt 
acute kidney injury 

diagnosis 
creatine kinase >1000 U/L 
consistent clinical ft

management 
aggressive IV fluid resuscitation 
sodium bicarbonate in some cases

QID 16358

42 yo man is broguht to the emergency due to weakness 

the patient drinks alcohol faily and has been ebinge drinkning for th epast 2 days. he also used cocaine the previous night. this morning the patient stumbles and fell several time swhile trying to the tot. backtheroom. he has no other medical problems and takes no medications. temp is 37C, blood pressure is 160/100, pulse is 102, reps are 18. oxygen is 96. physical examination shows mildly dialted pupils. the oropharynx is clear and there is no jugular venous distention. cardiopulmonary examination is normal. the abdomen is soft and nontender, but sensation to touch and vibration is normal. upper extremity examination shows no abnormalities. over the next several days, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complication of his current condition? 

1. acute kidney injury (c)
2. acute respiratory failure 
3. bulbary muscle weakness 
4. optic neuropathy 
5. severe hyponatremia 

this patient's clinical features are consistent with drug-induced rhabdomyolysis. alcohol binges can cause acute alcohol myopathy that predominantly affects the lower extremitites, causing pain, weakness and sweeling. it likely occurs via direct toxicitiy of ethanol and its metabolites, leading to disruption of myocyte membranes. cocaine abuse further contributes to muscle damage via both vasoconstrictive skeletal muscle ischemia and direct myocyte toxicity. 

up to 50% of patients with rhabdomyolysis will develop AKI. during muscle cell lysis, intravascular fluid is shifted intot the damaged muscle tissue, and heme containing myoglobin is released in to tht ebloodstream. the intravascular volume depletion causes an initial prerenal insult, which is followed by a subsequenet insult from direct tubular toxicity of heme (pigment nephropathy)

treatment of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive volume resuscutation to replace intramuscular and intravenous fluid. affected muscle groups must be monitored closely because the initial tissue damage and subsequent volume replacement create a risk for acute compartement syndrome. 

i did not understand any of it - bc i wasnt paying attention 

what is the crux of the problem - alcohol causes myoglobin damage!??
