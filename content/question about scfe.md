13 yo boy is seen in the office for persistent right knee pain 

he first noticed a dull pain along the anterior knee two months ago. initially, the pain was noticeable only after basketball practice. 2 days ago, the pain worsened after the patient landed during a rebound attempt at a basketball game. the knee pain is now constant and not releived with ibuprofen or ice. the patient has no chronic medical conditions. temperature is 37.4, height is at 75th percentile and wt is at 95th percentile. 

the patient walks with a limp with the right foot pointed laterally. there is no tenderness, erythema, or swelling around the right knee. the anterior and posterior drawer tests are normal. no abnormal findings during knee flexion and extension are present with either internal or external rotation of the tibia. range of motion of the right hip is limited, and the knee points laterally upon passive hip flexion. which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

1. anterior cruciate ligament tear 
2. medial meniscus tear 
3. osgood-schlatter disease 
4. osteoarthritis of the hip 
5. osteoid osteoma of the proximal femur
6. slipped capital femoral epiphysis (c)
7. transient synovitis of the hip 

slipped capital femoral epiphysis is characterized by anterolateral and superior displacement of the proximal femus along the physis (growth plate). it most commonly presents in obese adolescents with chronic hip pain. however, 15% of patients with SCFE have only referred thigh or knee pain, as seen here. due to the referred nature of the pain, knee examination is normal. characteristic findings on his examination however include limited internal rotation, which causes the foot to point laterally and thinh abduction and external rotation with passive hip flexion 

bilateral hip xrays are diagnositc for SCFE and show a posteriorly displaced femoral head.
