hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) should be suspected in neonates with delayed passage of meconium because virtually all full-term infants pass stool within 48 hours of birth. the disorder results from failed neural crest cell migration during fetal development of the enteric nervous system. the affected intestinal segment, most commonly the rectosigmoid colon, lacks innervation and the ability to relax and therefore remains chronically contracted. although usually an isolated defect, HD is also strongly related to Down syndrome. 

Newborns present with poor feeding, abdominal distension, failure to pass meconium, and bilious emesis. rectal examination shows increased tone and can produce an explosive expulsion of gas and stool (squirt sign) from temporary relief from the obstruction.
